I plan on getting vaccinated at some point, and no one can talk me out of it. This is not a question of efficacy or science vs BS, this is a question about ethics.

So a bit of background:

The country I live in has had a horrible vaccine rollout. Absolutely awful. As a result, we have a limited number of doses, and we're prioritizing at-risk populations.

I live in the most densely populated city in my country. As of a couple of days ago, they've begun opening up the vaccinations to any adult over 18, in what they designate as 'hot spots'. I live in a 'hot spot'.

I'm under 30 and by all accounts pretty healthy. I've been privileged enough to have stable housing and to have the ability to work from home for the duration  of the pandemic. And I know that vaccination won't suddenly make it so that I can see my family/friends again. My partner, who I live with, also doesn't have to go anywhere to work, so we're both at home and safe, aside from a weekly grocery trip.

Here's my quandary:

With vaccines being in such limited supply where I am, I truly believe that frontline workers, obviously healthcare folks, anyone in retail, food-service, factory/construction workers, basically anyone that needs to come into contact with other humans should be prioritized. Statistically where I live, workplace breakouts are responsible for so much of the spread, and those people deserve to be safe.

I also know that the more people who are vaccinated overall means generally better things. And while my risk is low, I can still catch it on those weekly grocery trips.

I feel like getting vaccinated now would steal doses from the people that really need them. But I also want to contribute to the overall lowering of the risk of serious illness/spread, and take potential pressure off of the overwhelmed hospital system in my area if I was to contract covid.

With all that being said... Should I get vaccinated now/ASAP? Or should I wait until more people have gotten it so that I'm not depriving a cashier or frontline worker of their chance to get vaccinated? 

I'm really torn. Any help is appreciated.",1618023071

6071df16840e1f541c7970ed,,false,"The “most neglected” beings are not only the “food” in the system, but also what we “humans” classify as “destroyers” &amp; “killers”, basically our “enemies”.

I am talking about the “insects” that destroy crops &amp; the “viruses” &amp; “bacteria” that try to hurt us &amp; kill us.

From a selfish subjective view, yes, we should destroy them before they destroy us.

However, from a unselfish nonsubjective view, did they get to decide what they are?

Their existence is immoral to them just like our existence is immoral to us.

I don’t think anyone of us really get to pick what we are but we are what we are and we’re just trying to live.

Remember that.

This is where our ability to “empathize” as “human beings” with other beings in the system comes in...

Let’s think this from their views.

What seems “wrong” to us is “not wrong” to them.

They might be “amoral” &amp; lacking a “moral sense” to know what they are doing is “wrong” (they just trying to live) nor they can communicate with us to let us know they’re trying to do less of it because they realize it is “wrong”.

Unlike them, as “human beings”, we have a “moral sense” that help us determine what we could be doing seems “wrong” so we could work on doing less of it or stop doing it.

Therefore, when we destroy them “for survival” is NOT morally justified either.

It is just “immoral” to do anything to any living beings “without their consent” (regardless if they can give consent or not or what the do to us).

It is also NOT “humane” either.

Humane is when you stop something from hurting you without hurting it.

That is “humane”.

Now let’s switch the “destroyer” &amp; “killer” to a human form of a “serial killer”.

Yes. It’s immoral what “he” or “she” is doing (I purposely include both pronouns to not discriminate males).

They are being “immoral” by ending people’s existence “without their consent”, doesn’t matter how horrible the people they killed are.

But we shouldn’t be ending their existence without their consent either (even though my vengeance side say you deserve wtf you do to others so that you’ll know how they feel depending on the situation).

That is not to say, I will not imprison them for breaking the law and to prevent them from harming other people.

But I will not feed them “food” that stem from any other living beings that also want to live (it’s not my responsibility to feed them anyway, in nature they are supposed to find their own food).

That’s just NOT fair nor humane to those beings that are “food”.

If you are a human being, an animal, a plant, or other living beings, why the fk should you die for them without your consent?

That is NOT fair nor humane to you.

If plants don’t feel “pain” nor “care about their existence” then I “might” give them up as “food” just because “pain” wins.

NOT because I value human’s life over plant’s life.

They all have equal “inherent living rights” to me because they are all “alive”.

But if plants do feel “pain” or “care about their existence” or any other “food” that is also like that, then I will just leave the criminals alone (not to die, or to starve, but just alone).

I will not prioritize their “life” over others’ life as a “human being” just because I am brainwashed by society to do so.

Yes, I am being immoral to them in a way because I am not allowing them to go find food by locking them up (but that is why they shouldn’t be breaking the law).

But it will be less immoral to everything else overall that also “live” because they also deserve a chance at life too.

I will give the criminals “water” however since water is “non-living”.

Anyway, as a “human being”, I will always go for whatever I think is less immoral to all beings, not just the one that I was set up by society to be brainwashed for.

I would also request for a way for them to end their existence “without any pain &amp; any suffering” that comes from NOTHING that is “alive” &amp; give them that option.

You could argue that the serial killer don’t want to be a serial killer either and is just doing what they are set out to do by creations.

True, but they have the “option” of getting help to prevent or limit their actions therefore they should try to seek it if they want “empathy”.

They have a “choice” as a person. But animals, plants, insects, bacteria, &amp; viruses “might” not.

That’s the difference.

As a last note, while in prison, the criminals could also request whatever they want that is “not alive” and I “might” consider giving that to them.

This is my current thought for now.

It might change as I think more about it.

\*I don’t like how Google Translate dehumanize “criminals” and “other living beings” when I use it either. Google have to work on this.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I thought some more about this and there are a few things I want to add.

1. When insects destroy “crops”, remember the “crops” are not ours.   
We own “nothing” in this system.  

We arrived into this world “empty handed”. Remember that.

Humans basically steal and manipulate plants into “crops” for our own use.   
Insects are stealing from “plants” just like humans are. 

We’re both “thieves” so why are we hating them for? 

2. “Viruses” &amp; “Bacteria” try to hurt us and kill us...

But we do the same shit to “animals” &amp; “plants” for survival too so why are we hating them for doing exactly what we are doing?

What makes you think “animals” &amp; “plants” don’t value their own life?  
Anyone that claim that they don’t are just ignorant and selfish af.

You just care about what you want and don’t give a fk about what other species want. 

Wtf makes you think our “inherent living rights” are more worthy than theirs?

I don’t think so. 

As a “human being”, I truly believe that everything that is “alive” have “equal inherent living rights”.

That’s “morality” to me. 

3. If it’s “immoral” for the criminals to eat the things that are “alive” that “could also feel pain”, then what about me? 

How is that fair that I get to eat them and the criminals do not?  
It’s not fair. 

I shouldn’t be eating things that are “alive” either especially if they feel “pain”.

That’s inhumane af. 

So if what we are eating DO NOT feel pain, then both me and the criminals will get to eat them (regardless if they care about their existence or not) just because “pain” wins (fk “pain”).

But if what we are eating DO FEEL pain, I would probably to choose to end my existence without any pain &amp; any suffering too just to be a “human being”. 

Once again, fk creations for this existence bullshit. 

It was a trap for us to be immoral for existence since as “human beings” we have a “moral sense”.

Even if we don’t eat, we’re always constantly killing something as long as we are alive it seems like.

This is why my mom should have never brought me into this stupid world where “pain” &amp; “immorality” exist. 

Hella shady existence. 

I could never be “moral” in this world no matter wtf I do it seems like...  
But I could still be a “human being” by trying to be as least “immoral” as I could while alive.

I guess that’s fine with me (for now).",1618005114

This is where our ability to “empathize” as “human beings” with other beings in the system comes in...

Let’s think this from their views.

What seems “wrong” to us is “not wrong” to them.

They might be “amoral” &amp; lacking a “moral sense” to know what they are doing is “wrong” (they just trying to live) nor they can communicate with us to let us know they’re trying to do less of it because they realize it is “wrong”.

Unlike them, as “human beings”, we have a “moral sense” that help us determine what we could be doing seems “wrong” so we could work on doing less of it or stop doing it.

Therefore, when we destroy them “for survival” is NOT morally justified either.

It is just “immoral” to do anything to any living beings “without their consent” (regardless if they can give consent or not or what the do to us).

It is also NOT “humane” either.

Humane is when you stop something from hurting you without hurting it.

That is “humane”.

Now let’s switch the “destroyer” &amp; “killer” to a human form of a “serial killer”.

Yes. It’s immoral what “he” or “she” is doing (I purposely include both pronouns to not discriminate males).

They are being “immoral” by ending people’s existence “without their consent”, doesn’t matter how horrible the people they killed are.

But we shouldn’t be ending their existence without their consent either (even though my vengeance side say you deserve wtf you do to others so that you’ll know how they feel depending on the situation).

That is not to say, I will not imprison them for breaking the law and to prevent them from harming other people.

But I will not feed them “food” that stem from any other living beings that also want to live (it’s not my responsibility to feed them anyway, in nature they are supposed to find their own food).

That’s just NOT fair nor humane to those beings that are “food”.

If you are a human being, an animal, a plant, or other living beings, why the fk should you die for them without your consent?

That is NOT fair nor humane to you.

If plants don’t feel “pain” nor “care about their existence” then I “might” give them up as “food” just because “pain” wins.

NOT because I value human’s life over plant’s life.

They all have equal “inherent living rights” to me because they are all “alive”.

But if plants do feel “pain” or “care about their existence” or any other “food” that is also like that, then I will just leave the criminals alone (not to die, or to starve, but just alone).

I will not prioritize their “life” over others’ life as a “human being” just because I am brainwashed by society to do so.

Yes, I am being immoral to them in a way because I am not allowing them to go find food by locking them up (but that is why they shouldn’t be breaking the law).

But it will be less immoral to everything else overall that also “live” because they also deserve a chance at life too.

I will give the criminals “water” however since water is “non-living”.

Anyway, as a “human being”, I will always go for whatever I think is less immoral to all beings, not just the one that I was set up by society to be brainwashed for.

I would also request for a way for them to end their existence “without any pain &amp; any suffering” that comes from NOTHING that is “alive” &amp; give them that option.

You could argue that the serial killer don’t want to be a serial killer either and is just doing what they are set out to do by creations.

True, but they have the “option” of getting help to prevent or limit their actions therefore they should try to seek it if they want “empathy”.

They have a “choice” as a person. But animals, plants, insects, bacteria, &amp; viruses “might” not.

That’s the difference.

As a last note, while in prison, the criminals could also request whatever they want that is “not alive” and I “might” consider giving that to them.

This is my current thought for now.

It might change as I think more about it.

\*I don’t like how Google Translate dehumanize “criminals” and “other living beings” when I use it either. Google have to work on this.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I thought some more about this and there are a few things I want to add.

1. When insects destroy “crops”, remember the “crops” are not ours.   
We own “nothing” in this system.  

We arrived into this world “empty handed”. Remember that.

Humans basically steal and manipulate plants into “crops” for our own use.   
Insects are stealing from “plants” just like humans are. 

We’re both “thieves” so why are we hating them for? 

2. “Viruses” &amp; “Bacteria” try to hurt us and kill us...

But we do the same shit to “animals” &amp; “plants” for survival too so why are we hating them for doing exactly what we are doing?

What makes you think “animals” &amp; “plants” don’t value their own life?  
Anyone that claim that they don’t are just ignorant and selfish af.

You just care about what you want and don’t give a fk about what other species want. 

Wtf makes you think our “inherent living rights” are more worthy than theirs?

I don’t think so. 

As a “human being”, I truly believe that everything that is “alive” have “equal inherent living rights”.

That’s “morality” to me. 

3. If it’s “immoral” for the criminals to eat the things that are “alive” that “could also feel pain”, then what about me? 

How is that fair that I get to eat them and the criminals do not?  
It’s not fair. 

I shouldn’t be eating things that are “alive” either especially if they feel “pain”.

That’s inhumane af. 

So if what we are eating DO NOT feel pain, then both me and the criminals will get to eat them (regardless if they care about their existence or not) just because “pain” wins (fk “pain”).

But if what we are eating DO FEEL pain, I would probably to choose to end my existence without any pain &amp; any suffering too just to be a “human being”. 

Once again, fk creations for this existence bullshit. 

It was a trap for us to be immoral for existence since as “human beings” we have a “moral sense”.

Even if we don’t eat, we’re always constantly killing something as long as we are alive it seems like.

This is why my mom should have never brought me into this stupid world where “pain” &amp; “immorality” exist. 

Hella shady existence. 

I could never be “moral” in this world no matter wtf I do it seems like...  
But I could still be a “human being” by trying to be as least “immoral” as I could while alive.

I guess that’s fine with me (for now).",1618005114

I plan on getting vaccinated at some point, and no one can talk me out of it. This is not a question of efficacy or science vs BS, this is a question about ethics.

So a bit of background:

The country I live in has had a horrible vaccine rollout. Absolutely awful. As a result, we have a limited number of doses, and we're prioritizing at-risk populations.

I live in the most densely populated city in my country. As of a couple of days ago, they've begun opening up the vaccinations to any adult over 18, in what they designate as 'hot spots'. I live in a 'hot spot'.

I'm under 30 and by all accounts pretty healthy. I've been privileged enough to have stable housing and to have the ability to work from home for the duration  of the pandemic. And I know that vaccination won't suddenly make it so that I can see my family/friends again. My partner, who I live with, also doesn't have to go anywhere to work, so we're both at home and safe, aside from a weekly grocery trip.

Here's my quandary:

With vaccines being in such limited supply where I am, I truly believe that frontline workers, obviously healthcare folks, anyone in retail, food-service, factory/construction workers, basically anyone that needs to come into contact with other humans should be prioritized. Statistically where I live, workplace breakouts are responsible for so much of the spread, and those people deserve to be safe.

I also know that the more people who are vaccinated overall means generally better things. And while my risk is low, I can still catch it on those weekly grocery trips.

I feel like getting vaccinated now would steal doses from the people that really need them. But I also want to contribute to the overall lowering of the risk of serious illness/spread, and take potential pressure off of the overwhelmed hospital system in my area if I was to contract covid.

With all that being said... Should I get vaccinated now/ASAP? Or should I wait until more people have gotten it so that I'm not depriving a cashier or frontline worker of their chance to get vaccinated? 

I'm really torn. Any help is appreciated.",1618023071

From a selfish subjective view, yes, we should destroy them before they destroy us.

However, from a unselfish nonsubjective view, did they get to decide what they are?

Their existence is immoral to them just like our existence is immoral to us.

Here's my quandary:

With vaccines being in such limited supply where I am, I truly believe that frontline workers, obviously healthcare folks, anyone in retail, food-service, factory/construction workers, basically anyone that needs to come into contact with other humans should be prioritized. Statistically where I live, workplace breakouts are responsible for so much of the spread, and those people deserve to be safe.

I also know that the more people who are vaccinated overall means generally better things. And while my risk is low, I can still catch it on those weekly grocery trips.

I feel like getting vaccinated now would steal doses from the people that really need them. But I also want to contribute to the overall lowering of the risk of serious illness/spread, and take potential pressure off of the overwhelmed hospital system in my area if I was to contract covid.

With all that being said... Should I get vaccinated now/ASAP? Or should I wait until more people have gotten it so that I'm not depriving a cashier or frontline worker of their chance to get vaccinated? 

I'm really torn. Any help is appreciated.",1618023071

I am talking about the “insects” that destroy crops &amp; the “viruses” &amp; “bacteria” that try to hurt us &amp; kill us.

From a selfish subjective view, yes, we should destroy them before they destroy us.

However, from a unselfish nonsubjective view, did they get to decide what they are?

Their existence is immoral to them just like our existence is immoral to us.

I don’t think anyone of us really get to pick what we are but we are what we are and we’re just trying to live.

Remember that.

This is where our ability to “empathize” as “human beings” with other beings in the system comes in...

Let’s think this from their views.

What seems “wrong” to us is “not wrong” to them.

They might be “amoral” &amp; lacking a “moral sense” to know what they are doing is “wrong” (they just trying to live) nor they can communicate with us to let us know they’re trying to do less of it because they realize it is “wrong”.

Unlike them, as “human beings”, we have a “moral sense” that help us determine what we could be doing seems “wrong” so we could work on doing less of it or stop doing it.

Therefore, when we destroy them “for survival” is NOT morally justified either.

It is just “immoral” to do anything to any living beings “without their consent” (regardless if they can give consent or not or what the do to us).

It is also NOT “humane” either.

Humane is when you stop something from hurting you without hurting it.

That is “humane”.

Now let’s switch the “destroyer” &amp; “killer” to a human form of a “serial killer”.

Yes. It’s immoral what “he” or “she” is doing (I purposely include both pronouns to not discriminate males).

They are being “immoral” by ending people’s existence “without their consent”, doesn’t matter how horrible the people they killed are.

But we shouldn’t be ending their existence without their consent either (even though my vengeance side say you deserve wtf you do to others so that you’ll know how they feel depending on the situation).

That is not to say, I will not imprison them for breaking the law and to prevent them from harming other people.

But I will not feed them “food” that stem from any other living beings that also want to live (it’s not my responsibility to feed them anyway, in nature they are supposed to find their own food).

That’s just NOT fair nor humane to those beings that are “food”.

If you are a human being, an animal, a plant, or other living beings, why the fk should you die for them without your consent?

That is NOT fair nor humane to you.

If plants don’t feel “pain” nor “care about their existence” then I “might” give them up as “food” just because “pain” wins.

NOT because I value human’s life over plant’s life.

They all have equal “inherent living rights” to me because they are all “alive”.

But if plants do feel “pain” or “care about their existence” or any other “food” that is also like that, then I will just leave the criminals alone (not to die, or to starve, but just alone).

I will not prioritize their “life” over others’ life as a “human being” just because I am brainwashed by society to do so.

Yes, I am being immoral to them in a way because I am not allowing them to go find food by locking them up (but that is why they shouldn’t be breaking the law).

But it will be less immoral to everything else overall that also “live” because they also deserve a chance at life too.

I will give the criminals “water” however since water is “non-living”.

Anyway, as a “human being”, I will always go for whatever I think is less immoral to all beings, not just the one that I was set up by society to be brainwashed for.

I would also request for a way for them to end their existence “without any pain &amp; any suffering” that comes from NOTHING that is “alive” &amp; give them that option.

You could argue that the serial killer don’t want to be a serial killer either and is just doing what they are set out to do by creations.

True, but they have the “option” of getting help to prevent or limit their actions therefore they should try to seek it if they want “empathy”.

They have a “choice” as a person. But animals, plants, insects, bacteria, &amp; viruses “might” not.

That’s the difference.

As a last note, while in prison, the criminals could also request whatever they want that is “not alive” and I “might” consider giving that to them.

This is my current thought for now.

It might change as I think more about it.

\*I don’t like how Google Translate dehumanize “criminals” and “other living beings” when I use it either. Google have to work on this.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I thought some more about this and there are a few things I want to add.

1. When insects destroy “crops”, remember the “crops” are not ours.   
We own “nothing” in this system.  

We arrived into this world “empty handed”. Remember that.

Humans basically steal and manipulate plants into “crops” for our own use.   
Insects are stealing from “plants” just like humans are. 

We’re both “thieves” so why are we hating them for? 

2. “Viruses” &amp; “Bacteria” try to hurt us and kill us...

But we do the same shit to “animals” &amp; “plants” for survival too so why are we hating them for doing exactly what we are doing?

What makes you think “animals” &amp; “plants” don’t value their own life?  
Anyone that claim that they don’t are just ignorant and selfish af.

You just care about what you want and don’t give a fk about what other species want. 

Wtf makes you think our “inherent living rights” are more worthy than theirs?

I don’t think so. 

As a “human being”, I truly believe that everything that is “alive” have “equal inherent living rights”.

That’s “morality” to me. 

3. If it’s “immoral” for the criminals to eat the things that are “alive” that “could also feel pain”, then what about me? 

How is that fair that I get to eat them and the criminals do not?  
It’s not fair. 

I shouldn’t be eating things that are “alive” either especially if they feel “pain”.

That’s inhumane af. 

So if what we are eating DO NOT feel pain, then both me and the criminals will get to eat them (regardless if they care about their existence or not) just because “pain” wins (fk “pain”).

But if what we are eating DO FEEL pain, I would probably to choose to end my existence without any pain &amp; any suffering too just to be a “human being”. 

Once again, fk creations for this existence bullshit. 

It was a trap for us to be immoral for existence since as “human beings” we have a “moral sense”.

Even if we don’t eat, we’re always constantly killing something as long as we are alive it seems like.

This is why my mom should have never brought me into this stupid world where “pain” &amp; “immorality” exist. 

Hella shady existence. 

I could never be “moral” in this world no matter wtf I do it seems like...  
But I could still be a “human being” by trying to be as least “immoral” as I could while alive.

I plan on getting vaccinated at some point, and no one can talk me out of it. This is not a question of efficacy or science vs BS, this is a question about ethics.

So a bit of background:

The country I live in has had a horrible vaccine rollout. Absolutely awful. As a result, we have a limited number of doses, and we're prioritizing at-risk populations.

I live in the most densely populated city in my country. As of a couple of days ago, they've begun opening up the vaccinations to any adult over 18, in what they designate as 'hot spots'. I live in a 'hot spot'.

I'm under 30 and by all accounts pretty healthy. I've been privileged enough to have stable housing and to have the ability to work from home for the duration  of the pandemic. And I know that vaccination won't suddenly make it so that I can see my family/friends again.

They are saying here that the vaccines won’t cover the new variants but I don’t think they know for certain yet. It’s been slow to roll out vaccines and so many people are getting the virus amongst the younger (18-25) population yet they won’t close down grade schools. Kids are unable to get vaccinated as the vaccines are only approved for 16+ or 18+ so I expect that to be the next big group to get it as the schools are open, unvaccinated and they are getting restless. Summer is coming so they will want to hang out with friends. 

I don’t go out often but see many people out lately and only some are wearing masks which is very unfortunate. Just because masks are only mandatory in buildings, doesn’t mean you can’t wear one while walking to and from where you are going. Late at night people stop wearing masks as it seems to be mostly the homeless population or rowdy younger bunch. This is probably where it is spreading the most rather from restaurants which were tightly restricted/ tough precautions (now shut down except outside dining) or from work which is mostly distant work or tight precautions as well.

Businesses will fail now because it’s so hard to make any money because the restrictions are too tight. I understand they are in place for a good reason but having restaurants shut down except outside dining really doesn’t stop people from hanging out at night without masks around town. The restaurants are closed so why are people out? Either they are coming from outside dining or they are busy doing something else.

So I have some questions regarding the vaccines. I feel as though with today’s climate I should probably lead with the fact that I am not a Covid denier, anti vaxxer or anything Of the like. I do my part, mask up and social distance and all that but I have some questions...
So, a lot of my friends have been getting vaccinated and I ask myself why. Many of them think that now they’re immune to the virus and cant get it and that life goes back to normal for them and blah blah and seem quite confused when they learn that’s not the case. 
So, you get the vaccine. What’s changed? Nothing. You still have to mask up and social distance. You still can’t go to concerts or see a show without doing the above and at most places having to make a “reservation” and sit at a table the entire time. Stores and businesses still have limited hours and rules. Nothing has gone back to normal for you. 
My next point, you get the vaccine and now if you contract the virus you’ll be an a-symptomatic carrier. Isn’t this counter productive? If you’re vaccinated you can still catch and spread Covid but now because of the vaccine you may not even know you have it and could potentially be spreading it without even knowing it 

Aside from the social pressure of having to get vaccinated or you’re a trump loving Covid denying piece of shit, what benefit does the vaccine actually have? To me it just seems counter productive and the fact that people are wildly misinformed and think life goes back to normal for them only adds to the problem",1618237027

We all hate wearing masks and we know that they're not even the best defense against covid (yes it does help against big air particles, but the smaller ones go right trough) and that the N95 respirators are better, but they're bassicaly nowhere to be found or extremely overpriced.

Yes social distancing sucks, but let's be real, we already use reddit so we know how to connect with people without being next to them (discord, messanger and even fking Skype can help with it too).

Its hard, but if we just bite our teeth and push trough this like we did with everything that comes before, we can stop this bitch of a disease.
So even tho it's hard, just do it for a bit longer, the vaccine is already here, if we try a bit harder Covid will be history in a couple of years.

And also reduces the flow of oxygen into the body which causes the patient to die. After learning of this research, the Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed the treatment protocol of Covid-19 and gave aspirin to its positive patients.  100mg and started giving Empromax.  As a result, the patients started recovering and their health started showing improvement.  The Italian Ministry of Health discharged more than 14,000 patients in a single day and sent them home.

According to some other Italian scientists, ventilators and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were never needed.  Protocols for this have now been issued in Italy.
 CHINA already knew about it but never made its report public.
 Please share this information with all your family, neighbors, acquaintances, friends, colleagues so that they can get out of the fear of Covid-19 and understand that this is not a virus at all but just a bacterium that is exposed to 5G radiation.  The cause is harming people who have very low immunity.  This radiation also causes inflammation and hypoxia.  Those who fall prey to this should take Asprin-100mg and Apronix or Paracetamol 650mg.  Why… ???  क .Because it has been shown that covid-19 causes blood to clot which causes thrombosis to the person and due to which blood clots in the veins and due to this the brain, heart and lungs cannot get oxygen due to which the person  Breathing becomes difficult and a person dies quickly due to shortness of breath.
 Doctors in Italy disobeyed WHO's protocol and performed autopsies on corpses that had died of covid-19.  Doctors opened the arms, legs and other parts of the body and after examining and examining them properly, they noticed that the blood vessels were dilated and the veins were full of thrombi, which usually stopped the blood from flowing.  And also reduces the flow of oxygen into the body which causes the patient to die. After learning of this research, the Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed the treatment protocol of Covid-19 and gave aspirin to its positive patients.  100mg and started giving Empromax.  As a result, the patients started recovering and their health started showing improvement.  The Italian Ministry of Health discharged more than 14,000 patients in a single day and sent them home.

I got infected the 5 of April. I most likely got it from the plane I was on while traveling. I was in quarantine for 12 days and I was basically asymptomathic. Now I'm a 19 year old guy and I'm a very active person. I used to do swimming and gym daily before getting covid. I had a reletively tame quarantine. Apart from mild coughing and a runny nose I was completely fine. Altough I'm active and young I just want to remind people how this virus isn't just the same as the flu. I've been tested negative 3 days ago and I feel like my lungs aren't working 100%. I now experience shortness of breath from walks I would be fine with and I experienced very bad shortness of breath and fatigue while doing swimming practice. All these effects might just be my body recovering but as someone that had covid very mildly I believe covid leaves long-term effects on the human body. Not everyone would have long-term effects but the fact that I'm young and active yet I still experienced a change in my overall health made me realise how serious this virus really is. I'm really glad vaccines were found relatively early. I couldn't imagine my parents experiencing what I did as they would probably have it way worse.

Due to a high demand of people getting  sick, most of the hospitals in our country doesn't have available rooms.  We are still waiting for the hospital's signal to get in the hospital  and have a proper treatment for him...

608076753f7f2270101c4d9c,,false,I’m posting this for those like myself thought COVID was fake and was used for politics. Last Thursday my stepdad came down with a small cold and we didn’t think much of it. Fast forward a few days and he couldn’t eat or drink without throwing up and was sleeping 18 hours a day and was miserable. After I got home I came down with soreness all over followed by the worst fever of my life and a small cough. This fever was so bad I was at a 104 temp and was freezing. It was until I couldn’t breath anymore that I knew something was seriously wrong. My breathing got the the point of what looks like a new born baby breathing. I wanted to pass out from the lack of oxygen. I proceeded to go to the emergency room where I have been admitted and this is my 3rd day. I have a sever case of COVID pneumonia with a oxygen level at 82. So now that I’m in the hospital just turning over on my side feels like a just ran a 5k. I hope this open some people’s eyes to this COVID cause unfortunately I didn’t take serious until I was on my death bed,1618943674
608076753f7f2270101c4d9d,,false,"My parents and grandparents took the first dose. They were fine that day. Started to develop mild fever and body pain at around midnight. That turned into 102-103 fever on the second day. Doctor advised to take Calpol 650 and anti allergic meds. They were drowsy and tired the whole of second day. On the third day fever came down to about 99-100 with the body pain still there. Fourth day body pain was gone except the injected area on the arm (this stays for a nice 8-10 days). Fever was gone as well. 
P.S : Aged people (my grandparents) didn't seem to have urinal control for the initial 2 days. And make sure they take rest which is very important.

I got infected the 5 of April. I most likely got it from the plane I was on while traveling. I was in quarantine for 12 days and I was basically asymptomathic. Now I'm a 19 year old guy and I'm a very active person. I used to do swimming and gym daily before getting covid. I had a reletively tame quarantine. Apart from mild coughing and a runny nose I was completely fine. Altough I'm active and young I just want to remind people how this virus isn't just the same as the flu. I've been tested negative 3 days ago and I feel like my lungs aren't working 100%. I now experience shortness of breath from walks I would be fine with and I experienced very bad shortness of breath and fatigue while doing swimming practice. All these effects might just be my body recovering but as someone that had covid very mildly I believe covid leaves long-term effects on the human body. Not everyone would have long-term effects but the fact that I'm young and active yet I still experienced a change in my overall health made me realise how serious this virus really is. I'm really glad vaccines were found relatively early. I couldn't imagine my parents experiencing what I did as they would probably have it way worse.

60807ae2c990c65590c04ccc,,false,I’m posting this for those like myself thought COVID was fake and was used for politics. Last Thursday my stepdad came down with a small cold and we didn’t think much of it. Fast forward a few days and he couldn’t eat or drink without throwing up and was sleeping 18 hours a day and was miserable. After I got home I came down with soreness all over followed by the worst fever of my life and a small cough. This fever was so bad I was at a 104 temp and was freezing. It was until I couldn’t breath anymore that I knew something was seriously wrong. My breathing got the the point of what looks like a new born baby breathing. I wanted to pass out from the lack of oxygen. I proceeded to go to the emergency room where I have been admitted and this is my 3rd day. I have a sever case of COVID pneumonia with a oxygen level at 82. So now that I’m in the hospital just turning over on my side feels like a just ran a 5k. I hope this open some people’s eyes to this COVID cause unfortunately I didn’t take serious until I was on my death bed,1618943674
60807ae2c990c65590c04ccd,,false,"My parents and grandparents took the first dose. They were fine that day. Started to develop mild fever and body pain at around midnight. That turned into 102-103 fever on the second day. Doctor advised to take Calpol 650 and anti allergic meds. They were drowsy and tired the whole of second day. On the third day fever came down to about 99-100 with the body pain still there. Fourth day body pain was gone except the injected area on the arm (this stays for a nice 8-10 days). Fever was gone as well. 
P.S : Aged people (my grandparents) didn't seem to have urinal control for the initial 2 days. And make sure they take rest which is very important.

60807aecc990c65590c04cce,,false,"I was in therapy for severe germophobia and health anxiety for 2 years before COVID even hit, so feeling sick is not a temporary inconvenience for me.  I know if the first dose makes me sick I'll be hard pressed to go back for the second one.  Meaning I probably won't.  I wanted the J&amp;J shot but couldn't get it before it was ""paused"" so now I have to choose between the ones with worse side effects and am terrified.  This isn't normal anxiety, it's a diagnosed mental illness.  It borders on panic.  

I live in the middle of nowhere and if side effects like high fever, tachycardia or high blood pressure happen in the middle of the night like they have with some people, I won't have a ride to the hospital (40 miles away) and will have to call an ambulance which is embarrassing in a small town like mine.  **I'm a daily user of high doses of Tylenol with codeine, a stimulant &amp; TONS of supplements and other medications.  How can I know they won't have dangerous interactions with the vaccine?**

This isn't an ""ask your doctor"" situation.  I'm not getting it from my doctor but a group of random nurses who come to town administering it out of a health van thing.  Yeah.  I know I need to get the shot so I can go on with my life but I can't help thinking it's not a one-size-fits-all situation.  There are people who take all manner of meds and even recreational drugs, have health conditions, etc.  Is this safe for us/them?  

(I know not to take Tylenol before the shot to avoid suppressing my immune response but will be resuming it afterward to avoid withdrawal from my codeine.  Just don't want some crazy interaction to kill me like it might have killed [this] (https://wset.com/news/coronavirus/utah-woman-39-dies-4-days-after-2nd-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-autopsy-ordered-kassidi-kurill) woman).

60807aecc990c65590c04cd1,,false,"Hey everyone, I just want to share my experience with Covid-19 with you.

I got infected the 5 of April. I most likely got it from the plane I was on while traveling. I was in quarantine for 12 days and I was basically asymptomathic. Now I'm a 19 year old guy and I'm a very active person. I used to do swimming and gym daily before getting covid. I had a reletively tame quarantine. Apart from mild coughing and a runny nose I was completely fine. Altough I'm active and young I just want to remind people how this virus isn't just the same as the flu. I've been tested negative 3 days ago and I feel like my lungs aren't working 100%. I now experience shortness of breath from walks I would be fine with and I experienced very bad shortness of breath and fatigue while doing swimming practice. All these effects might just be my body recovering but as someone that had covid very mildly I believe covid leaves long-term effects on the human body. Not everyone would have long-term effects but the fact that I'm young and active yet I still experienced a change in my overall health made me realise how serious this virus really is. I'm really glad vaccines were found relatively early. I couldn't imagine my parents experiencing what I did as they would probably have it way worse.

Sorry if this post seems a little weird but I just wanted to share with people how even young and healthy people can get affected by the virus.",1618932879

6081e46b2ca45504c455a4ae,,false,"Hi all, 

Been browsing this subreddit for a few days leading up to my vaccination (1st dose). Just letting y’all know that I just received the Pfizer, and am waiting in the 15min recommended area by the pharmacy. The shot was literally senseless and quick, I didn’t feel any prick or poke or anything. 

I completely understand people being hesitant and skeptical and anxious, however I have been following the data for some time (I am a psychologist), and the overall benefit is well worth the potential risks. Read people’s stories on here, you don’t want COVID. Regardless if you have the perspective of “you have a 99.99% of living”, people who contracted and lived MAY live now with some sort of chronic illness. Please be mindful of that. I wish you all well and I will follow up tonight (it’s 1:15 PST).",1619122567
6081e46b2ca45504c455a4af,,false,"I'm in Canada. My province will soon be done with the 1st shots for people aged 45 and more.

Today they announced obese people will be able to book their appointment.

My BMI is 35. I am technically obese, but I see myself more like a chubby guy I guess. And I'm 32. I work from home but my son goes to daycare and my daughter should be back in school on May 3.

My wife says I should get the shot because I meet the criteria on paper and so it means I have increased risk and I should not consider myself immune because I WFH. But I don't want to take someone else's place and I'm sort of afraid I'll be judged by the people there.

Should I wait for my age group, or take the obese pass?",1619122523

I live in the US and go to grad school in the caribbean. I came home because we were doing online classes but need to go back at the beginning on May to start in person classes again. The island has extremely strict quarantine for incoming people and the island currently has no person to person covid cases (things are almost completely back to normal). They only have access to the astrazenica vaccine. At home my state didn't allow healthy young people to get the vaccine till recently ( like.. I just got the email that I'm allowed to get the vaccine) but if I get the first dose of either of the other two vaccines, I won't be in the states long enough to get the booster (leaving in less than 20 days) and won't be coming back till sometime in 2022.

Tuesday night, I started feeling nauseous then vomited for 6 hours. I got in bed, horrible leg cramps, body aches, and chills and finally went to sleep. I woke up with chest pain , severe headache and a sore spine, my back is killing. Took a 2 hr nap ( I usually can never get myself to nap) and was only able to eat a smoothie and bagel. Went to sleep ok last night but started feeling congested. Woke up today and my back and chest are so sore, as if I did a hard workout.

Also in case it matters, I'm in the UK. Just mentioning it as everyone always assumes everyone on the Internet is American lol, and covid rules do differ per country at times. 

I have never had covid symptoms, but took a test last weekend as I was asked to by the council (everyone in my area was asked). This came back on Monday as negative.
I also started taking pills for my allergy to dust on Monday and have taken one pill every morning since.

Since Monday my nose has been blocked at times and I can feel mucus build up at the back of my throat. I don't really feel the need to cough unless I laugh, inhale too sharply, or try to sing a song that's too high for my voice lol. I'm also a smoker and that has been fine so far.

I don't know if this could be covid (I cough but I wouldn't call it continuous? But then I'm not even sure what continuous means, I might take it too literally), I don't have a temperature as far as I know and I can smell and taste just fine.
I figured it might be a side effect from the allergy pills considering the timing, though it isn't mentioned as one on the info pamphlet.

Surely my luck can't be so bad that I'm fine for more than a year and then two days after I take my first test, catch it?",1619092005
6081e46b2ca45504c455a4b8,,false,"My parents are taking their vaccine this weekend and i am a bit concerned.

Is it true that after vaccine 1st dose, your immunity is at zero hence you have to be all the more careful till you get your next shot? Which for us Canadians would be after 3-4 months. So what does that mean? Do they completely isolate during this time? I live with my parents so from 3 of us, 1 that is me will be without vaccine. 

My mom has her dental appointment next week and is expected to get a root canal, so now we are confused if it will be ok for her to go to clinic after her 1st shot. Also, what are some of the meds we should keep at home in case they feel any side effects from the vaccine?

Can someone please shed some light on this?",1619087492

6081e511f2599a3ef4fc40eb,,false,"I'm hoping to get advice. My friend keeps putting down the vaccines. I haven't gotten mine yet (but until I do, I stay home, have groceries delivered, and don't really see anyone because I want to be safe until I'm vaccinated). She's constantly sending me messages saying incredibly disparaging things about the vaccine. I understand we're entitled to our opinions, but it makes me uncomfortable because I don't push my views on others. 

I have a child, whereas she doesn't. I've tried to explain that I need to protect my child as best I can by doing my part in staying safe. She carries on by saying the vaccine is Big Pharma controlling us (which aggravates me because my husband works for a pharmaceutical company), the vaccine has a microchip in it (meanwhile she carries a cell phone with GPS) and that the government is trying to harm us with the vaccine...because........it's a gut feeling of hers. Sigh.

What do I say? Sell crazy some place else?

I'm running out of steam with her. It's to the point where we argue because I have to tell her over and over that opinions are like assholes---we all have them. Alas, every day or so it's another bizarre text message about mind control. She wants to come visit us and I said no. I'm just tired of the same conversation. 

My parents have similar view points (not about mind control, just that they feel there's not enough evidence to support the safety of these vaccines so they won't get them). Meanwhile, they see neighbors and friends and it makes me uneasy because they don't socially distance. But it's their choice, so I can't do or say anything. It's also depressing me because they haven't seen us since October and only a handful of times outdoors before that, and they're missing out on their grandson during his toddler years when everything is new and exciting for him. It really bums me out. But I'm doing what I feel is right, and I'm keeping my son away from them because they don't take COVID seriously in my opinion. To each their own, but I have a responsibility to my family and until we're vaccinated, I have to keep my trio safe. My son and husband are my priority. 

I'm also unsure about some family gatherings on the horizon. Fast forward and say my husband and I are vaccinated; our son isn't. How safe are family gatherings with lots of unvaccinated children since they're too little to receive the vaccine? Am I too paranoid? I'm nervous to take my son around his little cousins. He only has masked play dates so far, or sees the one child up the street whose parents are like us---huper vigilant. I just don't know what to do some days and could really use advice. 

Sorry if this is more of a rant. I'm just struggling with COVID depression. We moved at the height of the pandemic so I barely have gotten acclimated with our new area and I feel very isolated. My neighbors do a lot of local events but they've all ditch the masks which freaks me out. As a collective whole, they've basically said EFF masks and boast this on social media. We live in a small rural town with not much to do. We're part of homeschool groups that have masked play dates, which does help with the isolation. Again, sorry to vent!

I also started taking pills for my allergy to dust on Monday and have taken one pill every morning since.

I understand we're entitled to our opinions, but it makes me uncomfortable because I don't push my views on others. 

I have a child, whereas she doesn't. I've tried to explain that I need to protect my child as best I can by doing my part in staying safe. She carries on by saying the vaccine is Big Pharma controlling us (which aggravates me because my husband works for a pharmaceutical company), the vaccine has a microchip in it (meanwhile she carries a cell phone with GPS) and that the government is trying to harm us with the vaccine...because........it's a gut feeling of hers.

I'm running out of steam with her. It's to the point where we argue because I have to tell her over and over that opinions are like assholes---we all have them.

My parents have similar view points (not about mind control, just that they feel there's not enough evidence to support the safety of these vaccines so they won't get them). Meanwhile, they see neighbors and friends and it makes me uneasy because they don't socially distance. But it's their choice, so I can't do or say anything. It's also depressing me because they haven't seen us since October and only a handful of times outdoors before that, and they're missing out on their grandson during his toddler years when everything is new and exciting for him. It really bums me out. But I'm doing what I feel is right, and I'm keeping my son away from them because they don't take COVID seriously in my opinion. To each their own, but I have a responsibility to my family and until we're vaccinated, I have to keep my trio safe. My son and husband are my priority. 

I'm also unsure about some family gatherings on the horizon. Fast forward and say my husband and I are vaccinated; our son isn't. How safe are family gatherings with lots of unvaccinated children since they're too little to receive the vaccine? Am I too paranoid? I'm nervous to take my son around his little cousins. He only has masked play dates so far, or sees the one child up the street whose parents are like us---huper vigilant. I just don't know what to do some days and could really use advice. 

Sorry if this is more of a rant. I'm just struggling with COVID depression. We moved at the height of the pandemic so I barely have gotten acclimated with our new area and I feel very isolated. My neighbors do a lot of local events but they've all ditch the masks which freaks me out. As a collective whole, they've basically said EFF masks and boast this on social media. We live in a small rural town with not much to do. We're part of homeschool groups that have masked play dates, which does help with the isolation. Again, sorry to vent!

I woke up with chest pain , severe headache and a sore spine, my back is killing. Took a 2 hr nap ( I usually can never get myself to nap) and was only able to eat a smoothie and bagel. Went to sleep ok last night but started feeling congested. Woke up today and my back and chest are so sore, as if I did a hard workout. Some other members of my family have had similar symptoms since Saturday, but mine are the most severe. I’m not sure if anyone else has experienced vomiting with covid or if this is just the stomach flu?",1619092207

Is it true that after vaccine 1st dose, your immunity is at zero hence you have to be all the more careful till you get your next shot? Which for us Canadians would be after 3-4 months. So what does that mean? Do they completely isolate during this time? I live with my parents so from 3 of us, 1 that is me will be without vaccine. 

My mom has her dental appointment next week and is expected to get a root canal, so now we are confused if it will be ok for her to go to clinic after her 1st shot. Also, what are some of the meds we should keep at home in case they feel any side effects from the vaccine?

Can someone please shed some light on this?",1619087492

Also in case it matters, I'm in the UK. Just mentioning it as everyone always assumes everyone on the Internet is American lol, and covid rules do differ per country at times. 

I have never had covid symptoms, but took a test last weekend as I was asked to by the council (everyone in my area was asked). This came back on Monday as negative.
I also started taking pills for my allergy to dust on Monday and have taken one pill every morning since.

Since Monday my nose has been blocked at times and I can feel mucus build up at the back of my throat. I don't really feel the need to cough unless I laugh, inhale too sharply, or try to sing a song that's too high for my voice lol. I'm also a smoker and that has been fine so far.

I don't know if this could be covid (I cough but I wouldn't call it continuous? But then I'm not even sure what continuous means, I might take it too literally), I don't have a temperature as far as I know and I can smell and taste just fine.
I figured it might be a side effect from the allergy pills considering the timing, though it isn't mentioned as one on the info pamphlet.

Surely my luck can't be so bad that I'm fine for more than a year and then two days after I take my first test, catch it?",1619092005
6081e856e69d0a1d88684902,,false,"I'm hoping to get advice. My friend keeps putting down the vaccines. I haven't gotten mine yet (but until I do, I stay home, have groceries delivered, and don't really see anyone because I want to be safe until I'm vaccinated). She's constantly sending me messages saying incredibly disparaging things about the vaccine. I understand we're entitled to our opinions, but it makes me uncomfortable because I don't push my views on others. 

I have a child, whereas she doesn't. I've tried to explain that I need to protect my child as best I can by doing my part in staying safe. She carries on by saying the vaccine is Big Pharma controlling us (which aggravates me because my husband works for a pharmaceutical company), the vaccine has a microchip in it (meanwhile she carries a cell phone with GPS) and that the government is trying to harm us with the vaccine...because........it's a gut feeling of hers. Sigh.

What do I say? Sell crazy some place else?

I'm running out of steam with her. It's to the point where we argue because I have to tell her over and over that opinions are like assholes---we all have them. Alas, every day or so it's another bizarre text message about mind control. She wants to come visit us and I said no. I'm just tired of the same conversation. 

My parents have similar view points (not about mind control, just that they feel there's not enough evidence to support the safety of these vaccines so they won't get them). Meanwhile, they see neighbors and friends and it makes me uneasy because they don't socially distance. But it's their choice, so I can't do or say anything. It's also depressing me because they haven't seen us since October and only a handful of times outdoors before that, and they're missing out on their grandson during his toddler years when everything is new and exciting for him. It really bums me out. But I'm doing what I feel is right, and I'm keeping my son away from them because they don't take COVID seriously in my opinion. To each their own, but I have a responsibility to my family and until we're vaccinated, I have to keep my trio safe. My son and husband are my priority. 

I'm also unsure about some family gatherings on the horizon. Fast forward and say my husband and I are vaccinated; our son isn't. How safe are family gatherings with lots of unvaccinated children since they're too little to receive the vaccine? Am I too paranoid? I'm nervous to take my son around his little cousins. He only has masked play dates so far, or sees the one child up the street whose parents are like us---huper vigilant. I just don't know what to do some days and could really use advice. 

Sorry if this is more of a rant. I'm just struggling with COVID depression. We moved at the height of the pandemic so I barely have gotten acclimated with our new area and I feel very isolated. My neighbors do a lot of local events but they've all ditch the masks which freaks me out. As a collective whole, they've basically said EFF masks and boast this on social media. We live in a small rural town with not much to do. We're part of homeschool groups that have masked play dates, which does help with the isolation. Again, sorry to vent!

Been browsing this subreddit for a few days leading up to my vaccination (1st dose). Just letting y’all know that I just received the Pfizer, and am waiting in the 15min recommended area by the pharmacy. The shot was literally senseless and quick, I didn’t feel any prick or poke or anything.

I haven't gotten mine yet (but until I do, I stay home, have groceries delivered, and don't really see anyone because I want to be safe until I'm vaccinated).

I understand we're entitled to our opinions, but it makes me uncomfortable because I don't push my views on others. 

I have a child, whereas she doesn't. I've tried to explain that I need to protect my child as best I can by doing my part in staying safe. She carries on by saying the vaccine is Big Pharma controlling us (which aggravates me because my husband works for a pharmaceutical company), the vaccine has a microchip in it (meanwhile she carries a cell phone with GPS) and that the government is trying to harm us with the vaccine...because........it's a gut feeling of hers. Sigh.

What do I say? Sell crazy some place else?

I'm running out of steam with her. It's to the point where we argue because I have to tell her over and over that opinions are like assholes---we all have them.

My parents have similar view points (not about mind control, just that they feel there's not enough evidence to support the safety of these vaccines so they won't get them). Meanwhile, they see neighbors and friends and it makes me uneasy because they don't socially distance. But it's their choice, so I can't do or say anything. It's also depressing me because they haven't seen us since October and only a handful of times outdoors before that, and they're missing out on their grandson during his toddler years when everything is new and exciting for him. It really bums me out. But I'm doing what I feel is right, and I'm keeping my son away from them because they don't take COVID seriously in my opinion. To each their own, but I have a responsibility to my family and until we're vaccinated, I have to keep my trio safe. My son and husband are my priority. 

I'm also unsure about some family gatherings on the horizon. Fast forward and say my husband and I are vaccinated; our son isn't. How safe are family gatherings with lots of unvaccinated children since they're too little to receive the vaccine? Am I too paranoid? I'm nervous to take my son around his little cousins. He only has masked play dates so far, or sees the one child up the street whose parents are like us---huper vigilant. I just don't know what to do some days and could really use advice. 

Sorry if this is more of a rant. I'm just struggling with COVID depression. We moved at the height of the pandemic so I barely have gotten acclimated with our new area and I feel very isolated. My neighbors do a lot of local events but they've all ditch the masks which freaks me out. As a collective whole, they've basically said EFF masks and boast this on social media. We live in a small rural town with not much to do. We're part of homeschool groups that have masked play dates, which does help with the isolation. Again, sorry to vent!

Been browsing this subreddit for a few days leading up to my vaccination (1st dose). Just letting y’all know that I just received the Pfizer, and am waiting in the 15min recommended area by the pharmacy. The shot was literally senseless and quick, I didn’t feel any prick or poke or anything. 

I completely understand people being hesitant and skeptical and anxious, however I have been following the data for some time (I am a psychologist), and the overall benefit is well worth the potential risks. Read people’s stories on here, you don’t want COVID. Regardless if you have the perspective of “you have a 99.99% of living”, people who contracted and lived MAY live now with some sort of chronic illness. Please be mindful of that. I wish you all well and I will follow up tonight (it’s 1:15 PST).",1619122567

My wife says I should get the shot because I meet the criteria on paper and so it means I have increased risk and I should not consider myself immune because I WFH. But I don't want to take someone else's place and I'm sort of afraid I'll be judged by the people there.

My neighbors do a lot of local events but they've all ditch the masks which freaks me out. As a collective whole, they've basically said EFF masks and boast this on social media. We live in a small rural town with not much to do. We're part of homeschool groups that have masked play dates, which does help with the isolation. Again, sorry to vent!

60858e62a52b0a1df4bd27cd,,false,"It is a long story but i'll start where i can. (typing this out is going to be a bitch.) So the start of 2020. Obviously this was something everyone can relate to. March 3rd. This is before any covid news hit the u.s. I was at work when i got a call from my husband, my dad had fallen down the stairs of my childhood home.

 I knew something was wrong, my dad had never fallen out of nowhere before, he was only 56. I called my dad, and he sounded exhausted, so tired he could barely speak. Luckily, i only worked 3 minutes away EXACTLY..

 I asked him if he needed medical attention and he said he wasnt sure. I quickly hung up with my dad and darted to my truck across the parkinlot. As i am running, i CALL 911 AND tell them to meet me there.

  Now REWIND 24 HOURS, when i left for work that morning, there is a set of rail road tracks that run through our whole neighborhood. This train was sitting behind my house. FOR WEEKS!
    i had called multiple times to move this railcar. Its illegal to park where they did. They have an entire train yard 50 yards away. 

     So the day everything happened, they had finally moved this train, they blocked the neighboring street, tracks THEY NEVER USE! THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD. AFTER I GOT THE CALL ABOUT MY DAD I RUSH DOWN MY USUAL STREET AND ITS BLOCKED BY A TRAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 PLUS YEARS. 

     i go around. Im 2 minutes off. I run  up the stairs and unlock the doors. Ems never followed me in. I came back to the door and yelled WHT ARE YOU FUCKING WAITIN FOR!??! 
   I RUN UP THE STAIRS  looking at the blood from my father as i run to the second story, he had dragged himself back up the stairs.. 

    I see him, laying face down on his bed. He isnt moving. He isnt breathing. I shake him. I yell for him to wake up. DAD ! DAAAD! DAD WAKE UP! HE DOESNT MOVE. (I have medical experience) i notice he soiled himself, and then i knew. I was literally 2 minutes too late. 

Honestly TOLEDO ems. Y'ALL NEED SOME WORK! SO.
 My dad, hes gone. Then came his father. I moved from ohio to tn. Cared for my grandfather for a few months til he eventually succumbed to kidney failure without dialisys.

  It's messed up. I still havnt found a way to deal with my loss.

  I not only lost my father and grandfather before covid. I had to Deal with my loss in quarantine. But just before this, i lost both of my grandmothers, my closest uncle, my husbands father....
 and i just cant help but wonder. Was it covid before covid started??? 

  It was already here but we had no warnings. No one had traveled in my family. We lost 8 people im 3 months BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT DID ANYTHING!!! AM I WORNG??? 

Ok editing, to make paragraphs... cuz thats a thing.",1619317722
60858e62a52b0a1df4bd27d2,,false,"Hello, I have had numerous arguments with my father about the death rate and infection rate of covid-19 and how he undersells it. I try to always do my own research on topics via scientific journals and more middle ground media. While I in my head have my thoughts about what things are from what I picked up, I feel my father is just quoting things that lean towards what we feels is right/is true. Today he quoted the following three paragraphs from [this article](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4425/rr-31) which I don't really believe is wholly true and might be cherry picking; pushing the ""covid is just the flu"" narrative:

&gt;Suppression of science and lack of open debate has impinged enormously on three issues of fundamental significance. Firstly, public fear of Covid has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion to the actual danger. A recent peer-reviewed paper by one of the world’s most cited and respected scientist, Professor John Ioannidis of Stanford University, quotes an infection fatality rate (IFR) for Covid of 0.00-0.57% (0.05% for under 70s), far lower than originally feared and no different to severe flu [3]. This paper is published on WHO’s own Bulletin but ignored by UK mainstream media.

 

&gt;Secondly, although deaths are currently running at normal levels, fear is being driven by inflation of Covid “cases” caused by inappropriate use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test [4-7]. This test is hypersensitive and highly susceptible to contamination, particularly when not processed with utmost rigour by properly trained staff. Case inflation also occurs from use of excessive number of rounds of amplification cycles (termed CT) which amplifies non-infectious viral fragments and cross-reacting nucleotides from non-Covid coronaviruses/other respiratory viruses. These become mis-labelled as Covid. Even Dr Fauci confirms that a positive result using CT above 34 is invalid (Twitter thread, Jeff Nelson @vegsource 30 October 2020) but in the UK CTs may go up to 45, as confirmed by Professor Carl Heneghan of Oxford University’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine: (House of Commons Science &amp; Tech Committee, 17 Sep, 2020 YouTube.) An obvious improvement is to immediately halt any use of CTs above 34 and ensure that for CTs between 25 and 34, two consecutive positive results are required before confirming a case as Covid positive.

 

&gt;According to Professor Brookes, a Health Data Scientist from the University of Leicester, the UK’s official data shows no excess deaths due to respiratory infections this season (talkRadio, 'The number of people dying today is the same as it would be any other year', 17 November 2020 YouTube). Instead, excess total deaths have been driven by lack of treatment due to hospital closure/lockdowns and have occurred mostly at home. Whilst there is no question that the first wave of Covid, a then novel virus, was lethal to many, there is no sound evidence of any second wave.

 

&gt;The third and possibly the most consequential suppression of science relates to the narrative that people do not develop immunity following a Covid infection. We know that immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is very durable, persisting for at least 12-17 years [8-10]. Immunologists know that immunity to SARS-Cov-2 is no different. This is confirmed by many eminent scientists including Beda M Stadler, the former Director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Bern and Professor Emeritus (Ivor Cummins, Ep91 Emeritus Professor of Immunology...Reveals Crucial Viral Immunity Reality, 28 July 2020, YouTube), and Sucharit Bhakdi, former Chair of Medical Microbiology at the University of Mainz [11]. The human population has encountered and co-existed with myriad coronaviruses throughout evolution. Most of us therefore have cross-reacting T-cells, B cells and antibodies derived from encounters with cold coronaviruses that can recognise SARS-CoV-2 [12-14], in the same way that people “immunised” with cowpox became less susceptible to serious illness from smallpox - as Edward Jenner discovered in 1796. This is why we do not generally die from cold coronaviruses and precisely why so many of us were not susceptible to falling severely ill from Covid earlier this year. Even the chance of passing Covid to your spouse at the height of the pandemic was as low as 17%! [15 ].

Is all or any of this publication accurate? If not, whats a good mix of sources that I can look into and let him know about? I want to be as clear on the topic as possible because I am aware of misinformation campaigns that are about right now.

Hello, Friends all Nation! I would like to concern you all regarding the devastating corona case in **INDIA**. Every day lakh’s of people are being affected by corona. Thousand’s of people are dying daily in every region of our country. Each day we break our record of patients and death tolls. Doctors, Politicians, the Army, industrialists, Entrepreneurs, Religious institutes, NGO’s and many sections of our societies are trying their best to help each other in these devastating conditions. Due to record cases, hospitals are treating patients in full capacity. Tones of oxygen are used daily for treatment in these hospitals. Lots of medicine are used for the treatment of patients daily. Due to this many of the regions in our country have an acute shortage of oxygen and essential medicine. Our Pharma Industries are trying their best by working at full capacity to deal with this shortage of medicine and oxygen. Some countries are already helping us by providing oxygen tanks, airlifting mobile oxygen plants, providing us doses of vaccines as much as they can. But after all these efforts are being made the conditions are getting worse day by day. People are traumatizing with fear! Families are losing their loved ones, Doctors are losing their will. Fear is arising among all of us. But all we have is hope!

I urge all the people who read this to please provide the people of India, **Hope!**

**Hope to live again, to be with our loved ones again, to be healthy again, to live with freedom again, and to be United AGAIN!**

Your one small wish to concern about this situation for us can ignite the ray of hope again among ourselves to overcome our fear now.

60858e62a52b0a1df4bd27d4,,false,"So, I should preface by explaining that I have severe anxiety that manifests in multiple ways, including physical symptoms and really bad OCD. This was BEFORE covid. Now...it's impossible to describe. My own mind is my worst enemy, the anxiety never stops. Calling it 'coronaphobia' doesn't begin to cover my fear. For the first 3 months I wouldn't leave the INSIDE of my house. And I still won't go into the backyard without a mask.

So right now, I'm worried about starting to go out/be around people again with vaccines rolling out (I'm getting my second Pfizer Ednesday- and already paranoid about both having and not having side effects, but anyway). Like, what if vaccine passports aren't utilized? Will it just never be safe to go to indoor restaurants or movie theaters again? 

And even if they are, what about different vaccines? I know everything they say about how we can't KNOW the vaccines aren't equal, but enough new studies have been done to show the numbers are still pretty significantly different. And literally ALL the focus is on just any vaccine that prevents death. I get that that's the most important factor, I really do. But it seems like nobody even CARES about reducing the chance of actually getting infected anymore. And when even asymptomatic infections can lead to long term health problems, is it safe to be close with someone who got, say, Johnson and Johnson as opposed to Pfizer or Moderna? 

I know all the statistics, I know what the experts say. I know I'm protected to the extent my vaccine allows, but vaccines also rely on other people being vaccinated (and the extent to which they are) in order to provide minimal risk. Even with a vaccine, surveys show most people, like me, don't want to be in close contact with unvaccinated people. But what about vaccinated people with different efficacies, and therefore different chances of getting infected? For example, Johnson and Johnson leaves a significant chance for INFECTION open- is my Pfizer going to be as effective around people who got J and J as it is around people who got Moderna and Pfizer? Will we ever reach herd immunity (or even fully end the pandemic- not the virus, the actual pandemic) with a large part of the population only 66% vaccinated against actual infection (and I've read all the stuff about how you shouldn't compare the vaccines, they were tested at different times, blah blah blah- but Pfizer and Moderna have been tested since and still show stronger efficacy)? 

I already know what the experts say, but as I said before, I don't think the experts are considering all the risks- or, more likely, I think they're deliberately not ADDRESSING all the risks in a well-meaning but misguided attempt to get whatever vaccine in as many arms as soon as possible. 

I'm not even 30 yet, and my anxiety and depression and autism diagnosis mean I haven't even STARTED my life- will I have to live drowning in fear of covid for the rest of it?

(I'm really sorry for the length- I wanted to address everything and I have a tendency to be verbose while writing anyway &gt;.&lt; Also, please know that I don't mean to be rude or imply negative things about anyone based on their choice or availability, nor am I trying to create any kind of vaccine caste system. If anything came out poorly, I'm very sorry- like I said, I have aspergers and even though I try very hard, sometimes my words just come out badly. That's not what I intend at all- I'm just VERY anxious and afraid and wanted to be as honest/thorough as possible.)",1619305155

60859508054ad746a8b9ac7f,,false,"It is a long story but i'll start where i can. (typing this out is going to be a bitch.) So the start of 2020. Obviously this was something everyone can relate to. March 3rd. This is before any covid news hit the u.s. I was at work when i got a call from my husband, my dad had fallen down the stairs of my childhood home.

 I knew something was wrong, my dad had never fallen out of nowhere before, he was only 56. I called my dad, and he sounded exhausted, so tired he could barely speak. Luckily, i only worked 3 minutes away EXACTLY..

 I asked him if he needed medical attention and he said he wasnt sure. I quickly hung up with my dad and darted to my truck across the parkinlot. As i am running, i CALL 911 AND tell them to meet me there.

  Now REWIND 24 HOURS, when i left for work that morning, there is a set of rail road tracks that run through our whole neighborhood. This train was sitting behind my house. FOR WEEKS!
    i had called multiple times to move this railcar. Its illegal to park where they did. They have an entire train yard 50 yards away. 

     So the day everything happened, they had finally moved this train, they blocked the neighboring street, tracks THEY NEVER USE! THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD. AFTER I GOT THE CALL ABOUT MY DAD I RUSH DOWN MY USUAL STREET AND ITS BLOCKED BY A TRAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 PLUS YEARS. 

     i go around. Im 2 minutes off. I run  up the stairs and unlock the doors. Ems never followed me in. I came back to the door and yelled WHT ARE YOU FUCKING WAITIN FOR!??! 
   I RUN UP THE STAIRS  looking at the blood from my father as i run to the second story, he had dragged himself back up the stairs.. 

    I see him, laying face down on his bed. He isnt moving. He isnt breathing. I shake him. I yell for him to wake up. DAD ! DAAAD! DAD WAKE UP! HE DOESNT MOVE. (I have medical experience) i notice he soiled himself, and then i knew. I was literally 2 minutes too late. 

Honestly TOLEDO ems. Y'ALL NEED SOME WORK! SO.
 My dad, hes gone. Then came his father. I moved from ohio to tn. Cared for my grandfather for a few months til he eventually succumbed to kidney failure without dialisys.

  It's messed up. I still havnt found a way to deal with my loss.

  I not only lost my father and grandfather before covid. I had to Deal with my loss in quarantine. But just before this, i lost both of my grandmothers, my closest uncle, my husbands father....
 and i just cant help but wonder. Was it covid before covid started??? 

  It was already here but we had no warnings. No one had traveled in my family. We lost 8 people im 3 months BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT DID ANYTHING!!! AM I WORNG???

Hello, Friends all Nation! I would like to concern you all regarding the devastating corona case in **INDIA**. Every day lakh’s of people are being affected by corona. Thousand’s of people are dying daily in every region of our country. Each day we break our record of patients and death tolls. Doctors, Politicians, the Army, industrialists, Entrepreneurs, Religious institutes, NGO’s and many sections of our societies are trying their best to help each other in these devastating conditions. Due to record cases, hospitals are treating patients in full capacity. Tones of oxygen are used daily for treatment in these hospitals. Lots of medicine are used for the treatment of patients daily. Due to this many of the regions in our country have an acute shortage of oxygen and essential medicine. Our Pharma Industries are trying their best by working at full capacity to deal with this shortage of medicine and oxygen. Some countries are already helping us by providing oxygen tanks, airlifting mobile oxygen plants, providing us doses of vaccines as much as they can. But after all these efforts are being made the conditions are getting worse day by day. People are traumatizing with fear! Families are losing their loved ones, Doctors are losing their will. Fear is arising among all of us. But all we have is hope!

I urge all the people who read this to please provide the people of India, **Hope!**

**Hope to live again, to be with our loved ones again, to be healthy again, to live with freedom again, and to be United AGAIN!**

Your one small wish to concern about this situation for us can ignite the ray of hope again among ourselves to overcome our fear now.

Thank’s for reading this Sir/Madam.",1619281213
60859508054ad746a8b9ac84,,false,"Hello, I have had numerous arguments with my father about the death rate and infection rate of covid-19 and how he undersells it. I try to always do my own research on topics via scientific journals and more middle ground media. While I in my head have my thoughts about what things are from what I picked up, I feel my father is just quoting things that lean towards what we feels is right/is true. Today he quoted the following three paragraphs from [this article](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4425/rr-31) which I don't really believe is wholly true and might be cherry picking; pushing the ""covid is just the flu"" narrative:

&gt;Suppression of science and lack of open debate has impinged enormously on three issues of fundamental significance. Firstly, public fear of Covid has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion to the actual danger. A recent peer-reviewed paper by one of the world’s most cited and respected scientist, Professor John Ioannidis of Stanford University, quotes an infection fatality rate (IFR) for Covid of 0.00-0.57% (0.05% for under 70s), far lower than originally feared and no different to severe flu [3]. This paper is published on WHO’s own Bulletin but ignored by UK mainstream media.

 

&gt;Secondly, although deaths are currently running at normal levels, fear is being driven by inflation of Covid “cases” caused by inappropriate use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test [4-7]. This test is hypersensitive and highly susceptible to contamination, particularly when not processed with utmost rigour by properly trained staff. Case inflation also occurs from use of excessive number of rounds of amplification cycles (termed CT) which amplifies non-infectious viral fragments and cross-reacting nucleotides from non-Covid coronaviruses/other respiratory viruses. These become mis-labelled as Covid. Even Dr Fauci confirms that a positive result using CT above 34 is invalid (Twitter thread, Jeff Nelson @vegsource 30 October 2020) but in the UK CTs may go up to 45, as confirmed by Professor Carl Heneghan of Oxford University’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine: (House of Commons Science &amp; Tech Committee, 17 Sep, 2020 YouTube.) An obvious improvement is to immediately halt any use of CTs above 34 and ensure that for CTs between 25 and 34, two consecutive positive results are required before confirming a case as Covid positive.

 

&gt;According to Professor Brookes, a Health Data Scientist from the University of Leicester, the UK’s official data shows no excess deaths due to respiratory infections this season (talkRadio, 'The number of people dying today is the same as it would be any other year', 17 November 2020 YouTube). Instead, excess total deaths have been driven by lack of treatment due to hospital closure/lockdowns and have occurred mostly at home. Whilst there is no question that the first wave of Covid, a then novel virus, was lethal to many, there is no sound evidence of any second wave.

 

&gt;The third and possibly the most consequential suppression of science relates to the narrative that people do not develop immunity following a Covid infection. We know that immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is very durable, persisting for at least 12-17 years [8-10]. Immunologists know that immunity to SARS-Cov-2 is no different. This is confirmed by many eminent scientists including Beda M Stadler, the former Director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Bern and Professor Emeritus (Ivor Cummins, Ep91 Emeritus Professor of Immunology...Reveals Crucial Viral Immunity Reality, 28 July 2020, YouTube), and Sucharit Bhakdi, former Chair of Medical Microbiology at the University of Mainz [11]. The human population has encountered and co-existed with myriad coronaviruses throughout evolution. Most of us therefore have cross-reacting T-cells, B cells and antibodies derived from encounters with cold coronaviruses that can recognise SARS-CoV-2 [12-14], in the same way that people “immunised” with cowpox became less susceptible to serious illness from smallpox - as Edward Jenner discovered in 1796. This is why we do not generally die from cold coronaviruses and precisely why so many of us were not susceptible to falling severely ill from Covid earlier this year. Even the chance of passing Covid to your spouse at the height of the pandemic was as low as 17%! [15 ].

Is all or any of this publication accurate? If not, whats a good mix of sources that I can look into and let him know about? I want to be as clear on the topic as possible because I am aware of misinformation campaigns that are about right now. Thank for for at least reading through, and hopefully this can serve as a good reference for others in similar situations too!",1619315210
60859508054ad746a8b9ac85,,false,Hey so I am 17 and I got the pfizer shot and I had a pretty bad reaction the night of just getting a fever and chills but then 2 days later I wake up and there’s a huge rash on my face !?!??? Did anything like this happen to someone,1619307264
60859508054ad746a8b9ac86,,false,"So, I should preface by explaining that I have severe anxiety that manifests in multiple ways, including physical symptoms and really bad OCD. This was BEFORE covid. Now...it's impossible to describe. My own mind is my worst enemy, the anxiety never stops. Calling it 'coronaphobia' doesn't begin to cover my fear. For the first 3 months I wouldn't leave the INSIDE of my house. And I still won't go into the backyard without a mask.

So right now, I'm worried about starting to go out/be around people again with vaccines rolling out (I'm getting my second Pfizer Ednesday- and already paranoid about both having and not having side effects, but anyway). Like, what if vaccine passports aren't utilized? Will it just never be safe to go to indoor restaurants or movie theaters again? 

And even if they are, what about different vaccines? I know everything they say about how we can't KNOW the vaccines aren't equal, but enough new studies have been done to show the numbers are still pretty significantly different. And literally ALL the focus is on just any vaccine that prevents death. I get that that's the most important factor, I really do. But it seems like nobody even CARES about reducing the chance of actually getting infected anymore. And when even asymptomatic infections can lead to long term health problems, is it safe to be close with someone who got, say, Johnson and Johnson as opposed to Pfizer or Moderna? 

I know all the statistics, I know what the experts say. I know I'm protected to the extent my vaccine allows, but vaccines also rely on other people being vaccinated (and the extent to which they are) in order to provide minimal risk. Even with a vaccine, surveys show most people, like me, don't want to be in close contact with unvaccinated people. But what about vaccinated people with different efficacies, and therefore different chances of getting infected? For example, Johnson and Johnson leaves a significant chance for INFECTION open- is my Pfizer going to be as effective around people who got J and J as it is around people who got Moderna and Pfizer? Will we ever reach herd immunity (or even fully end the pandemic- not the virus, the actual pandemic) with a large part of the population only 66% vaccinated against actual infection (and I've read all the stuff about how you shouldn't compare the vaccines, they were tested at different times, blah blah blah- but Pfizer and Moderna have been tested since and still show stronger efficacy)? 

I already know what the experts say, but as I said before, I don't think the experts are considering all the risks- or, more likely, I think they're deliberately not ADDRESSING all the risks in a well-meaning but misguided attempt to get whatever vaccine in as many arms as soon as possible. 

I'm not even 30 yet, and my anxiety and depression and autism diagnosis mean I haven't even STARTED my life- will I have to live drowning in fear of covid for the rest of it?

(I'm really sorry for the length- I wanted to address everything and I have a tendency to be verbose while writing anyway &gt;.&lt; Also, please know that I don't mean to be rude or imply negative things about anyone based on their choice or availability, nor am I trying to create any kind of vaccine caste system. If anything came out poorly, I'm very sorry- like I said, I have aspergers and even though I try very hard, sometimes my words just come out badly. That's not what I intend at all- I'm just VERY anxious and afraid and wanted to be as honest/thorough as possible.)",1619305155
60859508054ad746a8b9ac87,,false,"Hi all, 

I had the second dose of Pfizer yesterday and have been crippled in bed all day due in large part to a headache. I has covid in Dec and had a very strange headache then and again after my first dose. But the headache I have today is different and I wonder if it should be cause for concern. I have taken two ES Tylenol and slept, but the uncomfortable pain in my neck and a tension in my forehead persist. I have been tossing and turning for hours it is so uncomfortable.

Thoughts?",1619291635
60859508054ad746a8b9ac88,,false,"This is gonna be a long one so pls be patient.

So, I’ve been going to the doctor/ER pretty often lately for reasons unrelated to COVID. I had to sign a waiver that said they treat COVID   patients in that hospital and it’s a possibility that I might get it. I also removed my mask for one of the tests they were running and in the bathroom. Dumb on my part, I know.

I started having weird body/leg aches, a fever that only lasted for a day, congestion in my nose, and a migraine. This went away and stopped bothering me a couple days ago. 

Last night, I was trying to sleep when I got super nauseous and felt my fever come back. I was super tired so I just went to sleep. When I woke up, my face was SUPER FLUSHED and warm (I am usually very pale in my face), a pounding headache, body aches, fever, chills and overall malaise.

I got tested about an hour ago but I have to wait 3 days for my results. Am I gonna die? I’m really nervous. Any tips for my symptoms while I wait for my results?",1619303578
60859508054ad746a8b9ac89,,false,"The seriousness of this matter I'm experiencing with Covid-19 has caused me to create this account and hopefully connect with someone that can share their similar experience with me. 

I started showing Covid-19 symptoms (thought it was a sinus infection) for 4 days, then tested positive on day 5. My symptoms were mild for the most part, much like a mild raspatory infection. However, day 7-8 of showing symptoms I started having shortness of breath. This lasted for only 2-3 days and then started to get better. The issue arising is I'm currently on day 15, and day 12-15 I have been having continuous coming and going of AWFUL headaches. These headaches literally debilitate me to lying in bed until it eventually passes. I've gone to the doctor and my vitals are fine and they said there is nothing directly causing the headaches besides they believe lasting Covid-19 symptom. 

My question is if anyone else has had lingering headaches similar to the timeline of mine? If so, how long did this headaches last and did anything help? I'm hoping my 3rd week from testing positive will hopefully phase these headaches out.",1619286116

And even if they are, what about different vaccines? I know everything they say about how we can't KNOW the vaccines aren't equal, but enough new studies have been done to show the numbers are still pretty significantly different. And literally ALL the focus is on just any vaccine that prevents death. I get that that's the most important factor, I really do. But it seems like nobody even CARES about reducing the chance of actually getting infected anymore. And when even asymptomatic infections can lead to long term health problems, is it safe to be close with someone who got, say, Johnson and Johnson as opposed to Pfizer or Moderna? 

I know all the statistics, I know what the experts say. I know I'm protected to the extent my vaccine allows, but vaccines also rely on other people being vaccinated (and the extent to which they are) in order to provide minimal risk. Even with a vaccine, surveys show most people, like me, don't want to be in close contact with unvaccinated people. But what about vaccinated people with different efficacies, and therefore different chances of getting infected? For example, Johnson and Johnson leaves a significant chance for INFECTION open- is my Pfizer going to be as effective around people who got J and J as it is around people who got Moderna and Pfizer? Will we ever reach herd immunity (or even fully end the pandemic- not the virus, the actual pandemic) with a large part of the population only 66% vaccinated against actual infection (and I've read all the stuff about how you shouldn't compare the vaccines, they were tested at different times, blah blah blah- but Pfizer and Moderna have been tested since and still show stronger efficacy)? 

I already know what the experts say, but as I said before, I don't think the experts are considering all the risks- or, more likely, I think they're deliberately not ADDRESSING all the risks in a well-meaning but misguided attempt to get whatever vaccine in as many arms as soon as possible. 

I'm not even 30 yet, and my anxiety and depression and autism diagnosis mean I haven't even STARTED my life- will I have to live drowning in fear of covid for the rest of it?

(I'm really sorry for the length- I wanted to address everything and I have a tendency to be verbose while writing anyway &gt;.&lt; Also, please know that I don't mean to be rude or imply negative things about anyone based on their choice or availability, nor am I trying to create any kind of vaccine caste system. If anything came out poorly, I'm very sorry- like I said, I have aspergers and even though I try very hard, sometimes my words just come out badly. That's not what I intend at all- I'm just VERY anxious and afraid and wanted to be as honest/thorough as possible.)",1619305155

I had the second dose of Pfizer yesterday and have been crippled in bed all day due in large part to a headache. I has covid in Dec and had a very strange headache then and again after my first dose. But the headache I have today is different and I wonder if it should be cause for concern. I have taken two ES Tylenol and slept, but the uncomfortable pain in my neck and a tension in my forehead persist. I have been tossing and turning for hours it is so uncomfortable.

So, I’ve been going to the doctor/ER pretty often lately for reasons unrelated to COVID. I had to sign a waiver that said they treat COVID   patients in that hospital and it’s a possibility that I might get it. I also removed my mask for one of the tests they were running and in the bathroom. Dumb on my part, I know.

I started having weird body/leg aches, a fever that only lasted for a day, congestion in my nose, and a migraine. This went away and stopped bothering me a couple days ago. 

Last night, I was trying to sleep when I got super nauseous and felt my fever come back. I was super tired so I just went to sleep. When I woke up, my face was SUPER FLUSHED and warm (I am usually very pale in my face), a pounding headache, body aches, fever, chills and overall malaise.

I got tested about an hour ago but I have to wait 3 days for my results. Am I gonna die? I’m really nervous. Any tips for my symptoms while I wait for my results?",1619303578

I started showing Covid-19 symptoms (thought it was a sinus infection) for 4 days, then tested positive on day 5. My symptoms were mild for the most part, much like a mild raspatory infection.

6085a4b80dced36d38a0f291,,false,"Hello, I have had numerous arguments with my father about the death rate and infection rate of covid-19 and how he undersells it. I try to always do my own research on topics via scientific journals and more middle ground media. While I in my head have my thoughts about what things are from what I picked up, I feel my father is just quoting things that lean towards what we feels is right/is true. Today he quoted the following three paragraphs from [this article](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4425/rr-31) which I don't really believe is wholly true and might be cherry picking; pushing the ""covid is just the flu"" narrative:

&gt;Suppression of science and lack of open debate has impinged enormously on three issues of fundamental significance. Firstly, public fear of Covid has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion to the actual danger. A recent peer-reviewed paper by one of the world’s most cited and respected scientist, Professor John Ioannidis of Stanford University, quotes an infection fatality rate (IFR) for Covid of 0.00-0.57% (0.05% for under 70s), far lower than originally feared and no different to severe flu [3]. This paper is published on WHO’s own Bulletin but ignored by UK mainstream media.

 

&gt;Secondly, although deaths are currently running at normal levels, fear is being driven by inflation of Covid “cases” caused by inappropriate use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test [4-7]. This test is hypersensitive and highly susceptible to contamination, particularly when not processed with utmost rigour by properly trained staff. Case inflation also occurs from use of excessive number of rounds of amplification cycles (termed CT) which amplifies non-infectious viral fragments and cross-reacting nucleotides from non-Covid coronaviruses/other respiratory viruses. These become mis-labelled as Covid. Even Dr Fauci confirms that a positive result using CT above 34 is invalid (Twitter thread, Jeff Nelson @vegsource 30 October 2020) but in the UK CTs may go up to 45, as confirmed by Professor Carl Heneghan of Oxford University’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine: (House of Commons Science &amp; Tech Committee, 17 Sep, 2020 YouTube.) An obvious improvement is to immediately halt any use of CTs above 34 and ensure that for CTs between 25 and 34, two consecutive positive results are required before confirming a case as Covid positive.

 

&gt;According to Professor Brookes, a Health Data Scientist from the University of Leicester, the UK’s official data shows no excess deaths due to respiratory infections this season (talkRadio, 'The number of people dying today is the same as it would be any other year', 17 November 2020 YouTube). Instead, excess total deaths have been driven by lack of treatment due to hospital closure/lockdowns and have occurred mostly at home. Whilst there is no question that the first wave of Covid, a then novel virus, was lethal to many, there is no sound evidence of any second wave.

 

&gt;The third and possibly the most consequential suppression of science relates to the narrative that people do not develop immunity following a Covid infection. We know that immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is very durable, persisting for at least 12-17 years [8-10]. Immunologists know that immunity to SARS-Cov-2 is no different. This is confirmed by many eminent scientists including Beda M Stadler, the former Director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Bern and Professor Emeritus (Ivor Cummins, Ep91 Emeritus Professor of Immunology...Reveals Crucial Viral Immunity Reality, 28 July 2020, YouTube), and Sucharit Bhakdi, former Chair of Medical Microbiology at the University of Mainz [11]. The human population has encountered and co-existed with myriad coronaviruses throughout evolution. Most of us therefore have cross-reacting T-cells, B cells and antibodies derived from encounters with cold coronaviruses that can recognise SARS-CoV-2 [12-14], in the same way that people “immunised” with cowpox became less susceptible to serious illness from smallpox - as Edward Jenner discovered in 1796. This is why we do not generally die from cold coronaviruses and precisely why so many of us were not susceptible to falling severely ill from Covid earlier this year. Even the chance of passing Covid to your spouse at the height of the pandemic was as low as 17%! [15 ].

Is all or any of this publication accurate? If not, whats a good mix of sources that I can look into and let him know about? I want to be as clear on the topic as possible because I am aware of misinformation campaigns that are about right now. Thank for for at least reading through, and hopefully this can serve as a good reference for others in similar situations too!",1619315210
6085a4b80dced36d38a0f293,,false,"So, I should preface by explaining that I have severe anxiety that manifests in multiple ways, including physical symptoms and really bad OCD. This was BEFORE covid. Now...it's impossible to describe. My own mind is my worst enemy, the anxiety never stops. Calling it 'coronaphobia' doesn't begin to cover my fear. For the first 3 months I wouldn't leave the INSIDE of my house. And I still won't go into the backyard without a mask.

So right now, I'm worried about starting to go out/be around people again with vaccines rolling out (I'm getting my second Pfizer Ednesday- and already paranoid about both having and not having side effects, but anyway).

Hello, Friends all Nation! I would like to concern you all regarding the devastating corona case in **INDIA**. Every day lakh’s of people are being affected by corona. Thousand’s of people are dying daily in every region of our country. Each day we break our record of patients and death tolls. Doctors, Politicians, the Army, industrialists, Entrepreneurs, Religious institutes, NGO’s and many sections of our societies are trying their best to help each other in these devastating conditions. Due to record cases, hospitals are treating patients in full capacity. Tones of oxygen are used daily for treatment in these hospitals. Lots of medicine are used for the treatment of patients daily. Due to this many of the regions in our country have an acute shortage of oxygen and essential medicine. Our Pharma Industries are trying their best by working at full capacity to deal with this shortage of medicine and oxygen. Some countries are already helping us by providing oxygen tanks, airlifting mobile oxygen plants, providing us doses of vaccines as much as they can. But after all these efforts are being made the conditions are getting worse day by day. People are traumatizing with fear! Families are losing their loved ones, Doctors are losing their will. Fear is arising among all of us. But all we have is hope!

I urge all the people who read this to please provide the people of India, **Hope!**

**Hope to live again, to be with our loved ones again, to be healthy again, to live with freedom again, and to be United AGAIN!**

Your one small wish to concern about this situation for us can ignite the ray of hope again among ourselves to overcome our fear now.

Thank’s for reading this Sir/Madam.",1619281213

Due to this many of the regions in our country have an acute shortage of oxygen and essential medicine. Our Pharma Industries are trying their best by working at full capacity to deal with this shortage of medicine and oxygen. Some countries are already helping us by providing oxygen tanks, airlifting mobile oxygen plants, providing us doses of vaccines as much as they can. But after all these efforts are being made the conditions are getting worse day by day. People are traumatizing with fear! Families are losing their loved ones, Doctors are losing their will. Fear is arising among all of us. But all we have is hope!

I urge all the people who read this to please provide the people of India, **Hope!**

**Hope to live again, to be with our loved ones again, to be healthy again, to live with freedom again, and to be United AGAIN!**

Your one small wish to concern about this situation for us can ignite the ray of hope again among ourselves to overcome our fear now.

6085a4b80dced36d38a0f2a0,,false,"Hello, I have had numerous arguments with my father about the death rate and infection rate of covid-19 and how he undersells it. I try to always do my own research on topics via scientific journals and more middle ground media. While I in my head have my thoughts about what things are from what I picked up, I feel my father is just quoting things that lean towards what we feels is right/is true. Today he quoted the following three paragraphs from [this article](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4425/rr-31) which I don't really believe is wholly true and might be cherry picking; pushing the ""covid is just the flu"" narrative:

&gt;Suppression of science and lack of open debate has impinged enormously on three issues of fundamental significance. Firstly, public fear of Covid has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion to the actual danger. A recent peer-reviewed paper by one of the world’s most cited and respected scientist, Professor John Ioannidis of Stanford University, quotes an infection fatality rate (IFR) for Covid of 0.00-0.57% (0.05% for under 70s), far lower than originally feared and no different to severe flu [3]. This paper is published on WHO’s own Bulletin but ignored by UK mainstream media.

 

&gt;Secondly, although deaths are currently running at normal levels, fear is being driven by inflation of Covid “cases” caused by inappropriate use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test [4-7]. This test is hypersensitive and highly susceptible to contamination, particularly when not processed with utmost rigour by properly trained staff. Case inflation also occurs from use of excessive number of rounds of amplification cycles (termed CT) which amplifies non-infectious viral fragments and cross-reacting nucleotides from non-Covid coronaviruses/other respiratory viruses. These become mis-labelled as Covid. Even Dr Fauci confirms that a positive result using CT above 34 is invalid (Twitter thread, Jeff Nelson @vegsource 30 October 2020) but in the UK CTs may go up to 45, as confirmed by Professor Carl Heneghan of Oxford University’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine: (House of Commons Science &amp; Tech Committee, 17 Sep, 2020 YouTube.) An obvious improvement is to immediately halt any use of CTs above 34 and ensure that for CTs between 25 and 34, two consecutive positive results are required before confirming a case as Covid positive.

 

&gt;According to Professor Brookes, a Health Data Scientist from the University of Leicester, the UK’s official data shows no excess deaths due to respiratory infections this season (talkRadio, 'The number of people dying today is the same as it would be any other year', 17 November 2020 YouTube). Instead, excess total deaths have been driven by lack of treatment due to hospital closure/lockdowns and have occurred mostly at home. Whilst there is no question that the first wave of Covid, a then novel virus, was lethal to many, there is no sound evidence of any second wave.

 

&gt;The third and possibly the most consequential suppression of science relates to the narrative that people do not develop immunity following a Covid infection. We know that immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is very durable, persisting for at least 12-17 years [8-10]. Immunologists know that immunity to SARS-Cov-2 is no different. This is confirmed by many eminent scientists including Beda M Stadler, the former Director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Bern and Professor Emeritus (Ivor Cummins, Ep91 Emeritus Professor of Immunology...Reveals Crucial Viral Immunity Reality, 28 July 2020, YouTube), and Sucharit Bhakdi, former Chair of Medical Microbiology at the University of Mainz [11]. The human population has encountered and co-existed with myriad coronaviruses throughout evolution. Most of us therefore have cross-reacting T-cells, B cells and antibodies derived from encounters with cold coronaviruses that can recognise SARS-CoV-2 [12-14], in the same way that people “immunised” with cowpox became less susceptible to serious illness from smallpox - as Edward Jenner discovered in 1796. This is why we do not generally die from cold coronaviruses and precisely why so many of us were not susceptible to falling severely ill from Covid earlier this year. Even the chance of passing Covid to your spouse at the height of the pandemic was as low as 17%! [15 ].

Is all or any of this publication accurate? If not, whats a good mix of sources that I can look into and let him know about? I want to be as clear on the topic as possible because I am aware of misinformation campaigns that are about right now.

6085a4b80dced36d38a0f2a1,,false,Hey so I am 17 and I got the pfizer shot and I had a pretty bad reaction the night of just getting a fever and chills but then 2 days later I wake up and there’s a huge rash on my face !?!??? Did anything like this happen to someone,1619307264
6085a4b80dced36d38a0f2a2,,false,"So, I should preface by explaining that I have severe anxiety that manifests in multiple ways, including physical symptoms and really bad OCD. This was BEFORE covid. Now...it's impossible to describe. My own mind is my worst enemy, the anxiety never stops. Calling it 'coronaphobia' doesn't begin to cover my fear. For the first 3 months I wouldn't leave the INSIDE of my house. And I still won't go into the backyard without a mask.

So right now, I'm worried about starting to go out/be around people again with vaccines rolling out (I'm getting my second Pfizer Ednesday- and already paranoid about both having and not having side effects, but anyway). Like, what if vaccine passports aren't utilized? Will it just never be safe to go to indoor restaurants or movie theaters again? 

And even if they are, what about different vaccines? I know everything they say about how we can't KNOW the vaccines aren't equal, but enough new studies have been done to show the numbers are still pretty significantly different. And literally ALL the focus is on just any vaccine that prevents death. I get that that's the most important factor, I really do. But it seems like nobody even CARES about reducing the chance of actually getting infected anymore. And when even asymptomatic infections can lead to long term health problems, is it safe to be close with someone who got, say, Johnson and Johnson as opposed to Pfizer or Moderna? 

I know all the statistics, I know what the experts say. I know I'm protected to the extent my vaccine allows, but vaccines also rely on other people being vaccinated (and the extent to which they are) in order to provide minimal risk. Even with a vaccine, surveys show most people, like me, don't want to be in close contact with unvaccinated people. But what about vaccinated people with different efficacies, and therefore different chances of getting infected? For example, Johnson and Johnson leaves a significant chance for INFECTION open- is my Pfizer going to be as effective around people who got J and J as it is around people who got Moderna and Pfizer? Will we ever reach herd immunity (or even fully end the pandemic- not the virus, the actual pandemic) with a large part of the population only 66% vaccinated against actual infection (and I've read all the stuff about how you shouldn't compare the vaccines, they were tested at different times, blah blah blah- but Pfizer and Moderna have been tested since and still show stronger efficacy)? 

I already know what the experts say, but as I said before, I don't think the experts are considering all the risks- or, more likely, I think they're deliberately not ADDRESSING all the risks in a well-meaning but misguided attempt to get whatever vaccine in as many arms as soon as possible. 

I'm not even 30 yet, and my anxiety and depression and autism diagnosis mean I haven't even STARTED my life- will I have to live drowning in fear of covid for the rest of it?

(I'm really sorry for the length- I wanted to address everything and I have a tendency to be verbose while writing anyway &gt;.&lt; Also, please know that I don't mean to be rude or imply negative things about anyone based on their choice or availability, nor am I trying to create any kind of vaccine caste system. If anything came out poorly, I'm very sorry- like I said, I have aspergers and even though I try very hard, sometimes my words just come out badly. That's not what I intend at all- I'm just VERY anxious and afraid and wanted to be as honest/thorough as possible.)",1619305155
6085a4b80dced36d38a0f2a3,,false,"Hi all, 

I had the second dose of Pfizer yesterday and have been crippled in bed all day due in large part to a headache. I has covid in Dec and had a very strange headache then and again after my first dose. But the headache I have today is different and I wonder if it should be cause for concern. I have taken two ES Tylenol and slept, but the uncomfortable pain in my neck and a tension in my forehead persist. I have been tossing and turning for hours it is so uncomfortable.

6085a4b80dced36d38a0f2a4,,false,"This is gonna be a long one so pls be patient.

So, I’ve been going to the doctor/ER pretty often lately for reasons unrelated to COVID. I had to sign a waiver that said they treat COVID   patients in that hospital and it’s a possibility that I might get it. I also removed my mask for one of the tests they were running and in the bathroom. Dumb on my part, I know.

I started having weird body/leg aches, a fever that only lasted for a day, congestion in my nose, and a migraine. This went away and stopped bothering me a couple days ago. 

Last night, I was trying to sleep when I got super nauseous and felt my fever come back. I was super tired so I just went to sleep. When I woke up, my face was SUPER FLUSHED and warm (I am usually very pale in my face), a pounding headache, body aches, fever, chills and overall malaise.

I got tested about an hour ago but I have to wait 3 days for my results. Am I gonna die? I’m really nervous. Any tips for my symptoms while I wait for my results?",1619303578
6085a4b80dced36d38a0f2a5,,false,"The seriousness of this matter I'm experiencing with Covid-19 has caused me to create this account and hopefully connect with someone that can share their similar experience with me. 

I started showing Covid-19 symptoms (thought it was a sinus infection) for 4 days, then tested positive on day 5. My symptoms were mild for the most part, much like a mild raspatory infection. However, day 7-8 of showing symptoms I started having shortness of breath. This lasted for only 2-3 days and then started to get better. The issue arising is I'm currently on day 15, and day 12-15 I have been having continuous coming and going of AWFUL headaches. These headaches literally debilitate me to lying in bed until it eventually passes. I've gone to the doctor and my vitals are fine and they said there is nothing directly causing the headaches besides they believe lasting Covid-19 symptom. 

My question is if anyone else has had lingering headaches similar to the timeline of mine? If so, how long did this headaches last and did anything help? I'm hoping my 3rd week from testing positive will hopefully phase these headaches out.",1619286116

6085a4c30dced36d38a0f2aa,,false,"It is a long story but i'll start where i can. (typing this out is going to be a bitch.) So the start of 2020. Obviously this was something everyone can relate to. March 3rd. This is before any covid news hit the u.s. I was at work when i got a call from my husband, my dad had fallen down the stairs of my childhood home.

 I knew something was wrong, my dad had never fallen out of nowhere before, he was only 56. I called my dad, and he sounded exhausted, so tired he could barely speak. Luckily, i only worked 3 minutes away EXACTLY..

 I asked him if he needed medical attention and he said he wasnt sure. I quickly hung up with my dad and darted to my truck across the parkinlot. As i am running, i CALL 911 AND tell them to meet me there.

  Now REWIND 24 HOURS, when i left for work that morning, there is a set of rail road tracks that run through our whole neighborhood. This train was sitting behind my house. FOR WEEKS!
    i had called multiple times to move this railcar. Its illegal to park where they did. They have an entire train yard 50 yards away. 

     So the day everything happened, they had finally moved this train, they blocked the neighboring street, tracks THEY NEVER USE! THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD. AFTER I GOT THE CALL ABOUT MY DAD I RUSH DOWN MY USUAL STREET AND ITS BLOCKED BY A TRAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 PLUS YEARS. 

     i go around. Im 2 minutes off. I run  up the stairs and unlock the doors. Ems never followed me in. I came back to the door and yelled WHT ARE YOU FUCKING WAITIN FOR!??! 
   I RUN UP THE STAIRS  looking at the blood from my father as i run to the second story, he had dragged himself back up the stairs.. 

    I see him, laying face down on his bed. He isnt moving. He isnt breathing. I shake him. I yell for him to wake up. DAD ! DAAAD! DAD WAKE UP! HE DOESNT MOVE. (I have medical experience) i notice he soiled himself, and then i knew. I was literally 2 minutes too late. 

Honestly TOLEDO ems. Y'ALL NEED SOME WORK! SO.
 My dad, hes gone. Then came his father. I moved from ohio to tn. Cared for my grandfather for a few months til he eventually succumbed to kidney failure without dialisys.

  It's messed up. I still havnt found a way to deal with my loss.

  I not only lost my father and grandfather before covid. I had to Deal with my loss in quarantine. But just before this, i lost both of my grandmothers, my closest uncle, my husbands father....
 and i just cant help but wonder. Was it covid before covid started??? 

  It was already here but we had no warnings. No one had traveled in my family. We lost 8 people im 3 months BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT DID ANYTHING!!! AM I WORNG???

I got tested about an hour ago but I have to wait 3 days for my results. Am I gonna die? I’m really nervous. Any tips for my symptoms while I wait for my results?",1619303578

I started showing Covid-19 symptoms (thought it was a sinus infection) for 4 days, then tested positive on day 5. My symptoms were mild for the most part, much like a mild raspatory infection. However, day 7-8 of showing symptoms I started having shortness of breath. This lasted for only 2-3 days and then started to get better. The issue arising is I'm currently on day 15, and day 12-15 I have been having continuous coming and going of AWFUL headaches. These headaches literally debilitate me to lying in bed until it eventually passes. I've gone to the doctor and my vitals are fine and they said there is nothing directly causing the headaches besides they believe lasting Covid-19 symptom.

6085a4c40dced36d38a0f2b9,,false,"It is a long story but i'll start where i can. (typing this out is going to be a bitch.) So the start of 2020. Obviously this was something everyone can relate to. March 3rd. This is before any covid news hit the u.s. I was at work when i got a call from my husband, my dad had fallen down the stairs of my childhood home.

 I knew something was wrong, my dad had never fallen out of nowhere before, he was only 56. I called my dad, and he sounded exhausted, so tired he could barely speak. Luckily, i only worked 3 minutes away EXACTLY..

 I asked him if he needed medical attention and he said he wasnt sure. I quickly hung up with my dad and darted to my truck across the parkinlot. As i am running, i CALL 911 AND tell them to meet me there.

  Now REWIND 24 HOURS, when i left for work that morning, there is a set of rail road tracks that run through our whole neighborhood. This train was sitting behind my house. FOR WEEKS!
    i had called multiple times to move this railcar. Its illegal to park where they did. They have an entire train yard 50 yards away. 

     So the day everything happened, they had finally moved this train, they blocked the neighboring street, tracks THEY NEVER USE! THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD. AFTER I GOT THE CALL ABOUT MY DAD I RUSH DOWN MY USUAL STREET AND ITS BLOCKED BY A TRAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 PLUS YEARS. 

     i go around. Im 2 minutes off. I run  up the stairs and unlock the doors. Ems never followed me in. I came back to the door and yelled WHT ARE YOU FUCKING WAITIN FOR!??! 
   I RUN UP THE STAIRS  looking at the blood from my father as i run to the second story, he had dragged himself back up the stairs.. 

    I see him, laying face down on his bed. He isnt moving. He isnt breathing. I shake him. I yell for him to wake up. DAD ! DAAAD! DAD WAKE UP! HE DOESNT MOVE. (I have medical experience) i notice he soiled himself, and then i knew. I was literally 2 minutes too late. 

Honestly TOLEDO ems. Y'ALL NEED SOME WORK! SO.
 My dad, hes gone. Then came his father. I moved from ohio to tn. Cared for my grandfather for a few months til he eventually succumbed to kidney failure without dialisys.

  It's messed up. I still havnt found a way to deal with my loss.

  I not only lost my father and grandfather before covid. I had to Deal with my loss in quarantine. But just before this, i lost both of my grandmothers, my closest uncle, my husbands father....
 and i just cant help but wonder. Was it covid before covid started??? 

  It was already here but we had no warnings. No one had traveled in my family. We lost 8 people im 3 months BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT DID ANYTHING!!! AM I WORNG???

Hello, Friends all Nation! I would like to concern you all regarding the devastating corona case in **INDIA**. Every day lakh’s of people are being affected by corona. Thousand’s of people are dying daily in every region of our country. Each day we break our record of patients and death tolls. Doctors, Politicians, the Army, industrialists, Entrepreneurs, Religious institutes, NGO’s and many sections of our societies are trying their best to help each other in these devastating conditions. Due to record cases, hospitals are treating patients in full capacity. Tones of oxygen are used daily for treatment in these hospitals. Lots of medicine are used for the treatment of patients daily. Due to this many of the regions in our country have an acute shortage of oxygen and essential medicine. Our Pharma Industries are trying their best by working at full capacity to deal with this shortage of medicine and oxygen. Some countries are already helping us by providing oxygen tanks, airlifting mobile oxygen plants, providing us doses of vaccines as much as they can. But after all these efforts are being made the conditions are getting worse day by day. People are traumatizing with fear! Families are losing their loved ones, Doctors are losing their will. Fear is arising among all of us. But all we have is hope!

I urge all the people who read this to please provide the people of India, **Hope!**

**Hope to live again, to be with our loved ones again, to be healthy again, to live with freedom again, and to be United AGAIN!**

Your one small wish to concern about this situation for us can ignite the ray of hope again among ourselves to overcome our fear now.

Thank’s for reading this Sir/Madam.",1619281213
6085a4c40dced36d38a0f2be,,false,"Hello, I have had numerous arguments with my father about the death rate and infection rate of covid-19 and how he undersells it. I try to always do my own research on topics via scientific journals and more middle ground media. While I in my head have my thoughts about what things are from what I picked up, I feel my father is just quoting things that lean towards what we feels is right/is true. Today he quoted the following three paragraphs from [this article](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4425/rr-31) which I don't really believe is wholly true and might be cherry picking; pushing the ""covid is just the flu"" narrative:

&gt;Suppression of science and lack of open debate has impinged enormously on three issues of fundamental significance. Firstly, public fear of Covid has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion to the actual danger. A recent peer-reviewed paper by one of the world’s most cited and respected scientist, Professor John Ioannidis of Stanford University, quotes an infection fatality rate (IFR) for Covid of 0.00-0.57% (0.05% for under 70s), far lower than originally feared and no different to severe flu [3]. This paper is published on WHO’s own Bulletin but ignored by UK mainstream media.

 

&gt;Secondly, although deaths are currently running at normal levels, fear is being driven by inflation of Covid “cases” caused by inappropriate use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test [4-7]. This test is hypersensitive and highly susceptible to contamination, particularly when not processed with utmost rigour by properly trained staff. Case inflation also occurs from use of excessive number of rounds of amplification cycles (termed CT) which amplifies non-infectious viral fragments and cross-reacting nucleotides from non-Covid coronaviruses/other respiratory viruses. These become mis-labelled as Covid. Even Dr Fauci confirms that a positive result using CT above 34 is invalid (Twitter thread, Jeff Nelson @vegsource 30 October 2020) but in the UK CTs may go up to 45, as confirmed by Professor Carl Heneghan of Oxford University’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine: (House of Commons Science &amp; Tech Committee, 17 Sep, 2020 YouTube.) An obvious improvement is to immediately halt any use of CTs above 34 and ensure that for CTs between 25 and 34, two consecutive positive results are required before confirming a case as Covid positive.

 

&gt;According to Professor Brookes, a Health Data Scientist from the University of Leicester, the UK’s official data shows no excess deaths due to respiratory infections this season (talkRadio, 'The number of people dying today is the same as it would be any other year', 17 November 2020 YouTube). Instead, excess total deaths have been driven by lack of treatment due to hospital closure/lockdowns and have occurred mostly at home. Whilst there is no question that the first wave of Covid, a then novel virus, was lethal to many, there is no sound evidence of any second wave.

 

&gt;The third and possibly the most consequential suppression of science relates to the narrative that people do not develop immunity following a Covid infection. We know that immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is very durable, persisting for at least 12-17 years [8-10]. Immunologists know that immunity to SARS-Cov-2 is no different. This is confirmed by many eminent scientists including Beda M Stadler, the former Director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Bern and Professor Emeritus (Ivor Cummins, Ep91 Emeritus Professor of Immunology...Reveals Crucial Viral Immunity Reality, 28 July 2020, YouTube), and Sucharit Bhakdi, former Chair of Medical Microbiology at the University of Mainz [11]. The human population has encountered and co-existed with myriad coronaviruses throughout evolution. Most of us therefore have cross-reacting T-cells, B cells and antibodies derived from encounters with cold coronaviruses that can recognise SARS-CoV-2 [12-14], in the same way that people “immunised” with cowpox became less susceptible to serious illness from smallpox - as Edward Jenner discovered in 1796. This is why we do not generally die from cold coronaviruses and precisely why so many of us were not susceptible to falling severely ill from Covid earlier this year. Even the chance of passing Covid to your spouse at the height of the pandemic was as low as 17%! [15 ].

Is all or any of this publication accurate? If not, whats a good mix of sources that I can look into and let him know about? I want to be as clear on the topic as possible because I am aware of misinformation campaigns that are about right now. Thank for for at least reading through, and hopefully this can serve as a good reference for others in similar situations too!",1619315210
6085a4c40dced36d38a0f2bf,,false,Hey so I am 17 and I got the pfizer shot and I had a pretty bad reaction the night of just getting a fever and chills but then 2 days later I wake up and there’s a huge rash on my face !?!??? Did anything like this happen to someone,1619307264
6085a4c40dced36d38a0f2c0,,false,"So, I should preface by explaining that I have severe anxiety that manifests in multiple ways, including physical symptoms and really bad OCD. This was BEFORE covid. Now...it's impossible to describe. My own mind is my worst enemy, the anxiety never stops. Calling it 'coronaphobia' doesn't begin to cover my fear. For the first 3 months I wouldn't leave the INSIDE of my house. And I still won't go into the backyard without a mask.

So right now, I'm worried about starting to go out/be around people again with vaccines rolling out (I'm getting my second Pfizer Ednesday- and already paranoid about both having and not having side effects, but anyway). Like, what if vaccine passports aren't utilized? Will it just never be safe to go to indoor restaurants or movie theaters again? 

And even if they are, what about different vaccines? I know everything they say about how we can't KNOW the vaccines aren't equal, but enough new studies have been done to show the numbers are still pretty significantly different. And literally ALL the focus is on just any vaccine that prevents death. I get that that's the most important factor, I really do. But it seems like nobody even CARES about reducing the chance of actually getting infected anymore. And when even asymptomatic infections can lead to long term health problems, is it safe to be close with someone who got, say, Johnson and Johnson as opposed to Pfizer or Moderna? 

I know all the statistics, I know what the experts say. I know I'm protected to the extent my vaccine allows, but vaccines also rely on other people being vaccinated (and the extent to which they are) in order to provide minimal risk. Even with a vaccine, surveys show most people, like me, don't want to be in close contact with unvaccinated people. But what about vaccinated people with different efficacies, and therefore different chances of getting infected? For example, Johnson and Johnson leaves a significant chance for INFECTION open- is my Pfizer going to be as effective around people who got J and J as it is around people who got Moderna and Pfizer? Will we ever reach herd immunity (or even fully end the pandemic- not the virus, the actual pandemic) with a large part of the population only 66% vaccinated against actual infection (and I've read all the stuff about how you shouldn't compare the vaccines, they were tested at different times, blah blah blah- but Pfizer and Moderna have been tested since and still show stronger efficacy)? 

I already know what the experts say, but as I said before, I don't think the experts are considering all the risks- or, more likely, I think they're deliberately not ADDRESSING all the risks in a well-meaning but misguided attempt to get whatever vaccine in as many arms as soon as possible. 

I'm not even 30 yet, and my anxiety and depression and autism diagnosis mean I haven't even STARTED my life- will I have to live drowning in fear of covid for the rest of it?

(I'm really sorry for the length- I wanted to address everything and I have a tendency to be verbose while writing anyway &gt;.&lt; Also, please know that I don't mean to be rude or imply negative things about anyone based on their choice or availability, nor am I trying to create any kind of vaccine caste system. If anything came out poorly, I'm very sorry- like I said, I have aspergers and even though I try very hard, sometimes my words just come out badly. That's not what I intend at all- I'm just VERY anxious and afraid and wanted to be as honest/thorough as possible.)",1619305155
6085a4c40dced36d38a0f2c1,,false,"Hi all, 

I had the second dose of Pfizer yesterday and have been crippled in bed all day due in large part to a headache. I has covid in Dec and had a very strange headache then and again after my first dose. But the headache I have today is different and I wonder if it should be cause for concern. I have taken two ES Tylenol and slept, but the uncomfortable pain in my neck and a tension in my forehead persist. I have been tossing and turning for hours it is so uncomfortable.

An obvious improvement is to immediately halt any use of CTs above 34 and ensure that for CTs between 25 and 34, two consecutive positive results are required before confirming a case as Covid positive.

 

&gt;According to Professor Brookes, a Health Data Scientist from the University of Leicester, the UK’s official data shows no excess deaths due to respiratory infections this season (talkRadio, 'The number of people dying today is the same as it would be any other year', 17 November 2020 YouTube). Instead, excess total deaths have been driven by lack of treatment due to hospital closure/lockdowns and have occurred mostly at home. Whilst there is no question that the first wave of Covid, a then novel virus, was lethal to many, there is no sound evidence of any second wave.

 

&gt;The third and possibly the most consequential suppression of science relates to the narrative that people do not develop immunity following a Covid infection. We know that immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is very durable, persisting for at least 12-17 years [8-10]. Immunologists know that immunity to SARS-Cov-2 is no different. This is confirmed by many eminent scientists including Beda M Stadler, the former Director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Bern and Professor Emeritus (Ivor Cummins, Ep91 Emeritus Professor of Immunology...Reveals Crucial Viral Immunity Reality, 28 July 2020, YouTube), and Sucharit Bhakdi, former Chair of Medical Microbiology at the University of Mainz [11]. The human population has encountered and co-existed with myriad coronaviruses throughout evolution. Most of us therefore have cross-reacting T-cells, B cells and antibodies derived from encounters with cold coronaviruses that can recognise SARS-CoV-2 [12-14], in the same way that people “immunised” with cowpox became less susceptible to serious illness from smallpox - as Edward Jenner discovered in 1796. This is why we do not generally die from cold coronaviruses and precisely why so many of us were not susceptible to falling severely ill from Covid earlier this year. Even the chance of passing Covid to your spouse at the height of the pandemic was as low as 17%! [15 ].

6085a4c40dced36d38a0f2ce,,false,Hey so I am 17 and I got the pfizer shot and I had a pretty bad reaction the night of just getting a fever and chills but then 2 days later I wake up and there’s a huge rash on my face !?!??? Did anything like this happen to someone,1619307264
6085a4c40dced36d38a0f2cf,,false,"So, I should preface by explaining that I have severe anxiety that manifests in multiple ways, including physical symptoms and really bad OCD. This was BEFORE covid. Now...it's impossible to describe. My own mind is my worst enemy, the anxiety never stops. Calling it 'coronaphobia' doesn't begin to cover my fear. For the first 3 months I wouldn't leave the INSIDE of my house. And I still won't go into the backyard without a mask.

So right now, I'm worried about starting to go out/be around people again with vaccines rolling out (I'm getting my second Pfizer Ednesday- and already paranoid about both having and not having side effects, but anyway). Like, what if vaccine passports aren't utilized? Will it just never be safe to go to indoor restaurants or movie theaters again? 

And even if they are, what about different vaccines? I know everything they say about how we can't KNOW the vaccines aren't equal, but enough new studies have been done to show the numbers are still pretty significantly different. And literally ALL the focus is on just any vaccine that prevents death. I get that that's the most important factor, I really do. But it seems like nobody even CARES about reducing the chance of actually getting infected anymore. And when even asymptomatic infections can lead to long term health problems, is it safe to be close with someone who got, say, Johnson and Johnson as opposed to Pfizer or Moderna? 

I know all the statistics, I know what the experts say. I know I'm protected to the extent my vaccine allows, but vaccines also rely on other people being vaccinated (and the extent to which they are) in order to provide minimal risk. Even with a vaccine, surveys show most people, like me, don't want to be in close contact with unvaccinated people. But what about vaccinated people with different efficacies, and therefore different chances of getting infected? For example, Johnson and Johnson leaves a significant chance for INFECTION open- is my Pfizer going to be as effective around people who got J and J as it is around people who got Moderna and Pfizer? Will we ever reach herd immunity (or even fully end the pandemic- not the virus, the actual pandemic) with a large part of the population only 66% vaccinated against actual infection (and I've read all the stuff about how you shouldn't compare the vaccines, they were tested at different times, blah blah blah- but Pfizer and Moderna have been tested since and still show stronger efficacy)? 

I already know what the experts say, but as I said before, I don't think the experts are considering all the risks- or, more likely, I think they're deliberately not ADDRESSING all the risks in a well-meaning but misguided attempt to get whatever vaccine in as many arms as soon as possible. 

I'm not even 30 yet, and my anxiety and depression and autism diagnosis mean I haven't even STARTED my life- will I have to live drowning in fear of covid for the rest of it?

(I'm really sorry for the length- I wanted to address everything and I have a tendency to be verbose while writing anyway &gt;.&lt; Also, please know that I don't mean to be rude or imply negative things about anyone based on their choice or availability, nor am I trying to create any kind of vaccine caste system. If anything came out poorly, I'm very sorry- like I said, I have aspergers and even though I try very hard, sometimes my words just come out badly. That's not what I intend at all- I'm just VERY anxious and afraid and wanted to be as honest/thorough as possible.)",1619305155

March 3rd. This is before any covid news hit the u.s. I was at work when i got a call from my husband, my dad had fallen down the stairs of my childhood home.

 I knew something was wrong, my dad had never fallen out of nowhere before, he was only 56. I called my dad, and he sounded exhausted, so tired he could barely speak. Luckily, i only worked 3 minutes away EXACTLY..

 I asked him if he needed medical attention and he said he wasnt sure. I quickly hung up with my dad and darted to my truck across the parkinlot. As i am running, i CALL 911 AND tell them to meet me there.

  Now REWIND 24 HOURS, when i left for work that morning, there is a set of rail road tracks that run through our whole neighborhood. This train was sitting behind my house. FOR WEEKS!
    i had called multiple times to move this railcar. Its illegal to park where they did. They have an entire train yard 50 yards away. 

     So the day everything happened, they had finally moved this train, they blocked the neighboring street, tracks THEY NEVER USE! THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD. AFTER I GOT THE CALL ABOUT MY DAD I RUSH DOWN MY USUAL STREET AND ITS BLOCKED BY A TRAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 PLUS YEARS. 

     i go around. Im 2 minutes off. I run  up the stairs and unlock the doors. Ems never followed me in. I came back to the door and yelled WHT ARE YOU FUCKING WAITIN FOR!??! 
   I RUN UP THE STAIRS  looking at the blood from my father as i run to the second story, he had dragged himself back up the stairs.. 

    I see him, laying face down on his bed. He isnt moving. He isnt breathing. I shake him. I yell for him to wake up. DAD ! DAAAD! DAD WAKE UP! HE DOESNT MOVE. (I have medical experience) i notice he soiled himself, and then i knew. I was literally 2 minutes too late. 

Honestly TOLEDO ems. Y'ALL NEED SOME WORK! SO.
 My dad, hes gone. Then came his father. I moved from ohio to tn. Cared for my grandfather for a few months til he eventually succumbed to kidney failure without dialisys.

  It's messed up. I still havnt found a way to deal with my loss.

  I not only lost my father and grandfather before covid. I had to Deal with my loss in quarantine. But just before this, i lost both of my grandmothers, my closest uncle, my husbands father....
 and i just cant help but wonder. Was it covid before covid started??? 

  It was already here but we had no warnings. No one had traveled in my family. We lost 8 people im 3 months BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT DID ANYTHING!!! AM I WORNG???

Hello, Friends all Nation! I would like to concern you all regarding the devastating corona case in **INDIA**. Every day lakh’s of people are being affected by corona. Thousand’s of people are dying daily in every region of our country. Each day we break our record of patients and death tolls. Doctors, Politicians, the Army, industrialists, Entrepreneurs, Religious institutes, NGO’s and many sections of our societies are trying their best to help each other in these devastating conditions. Due to record cases, hospitals are treating patients in full capacity. Tones of oxygen are used daily for treatment in these hospitals. Lots of medicine are used for the treatment of patients daily. Due to this many of the regions in our country have an acute shortage of oxygen and essential medicine. Our Pharma Industries are trying their best by working at full capacity to deal with this shortage of medicine and oxygen. Some countries are already helping us by providing oxygen tanks, airlifting mobile oxygen plants, providing us doses of vaccines as much as they can. But after all these efforts are being made the conditions are getting worse day by day. People are traumatizing with fear! Families are losing their loved ones, Doctors are losing their will. Fear is arising among all of us. But all we have is hope!

I urge all the people who read this to please provide the people of India, **Hope!**

**Hope to live again, to be with our loved ones again, to be healthy again, to live with freedom again, and to be United AGAIN!**

Your one small wish to concern about this situation for us can ignite the ray of hope again among ourselves to overcome our fear now.

Thank’s for reading this Sir/Madam.",1619281213
6085a4c60dced36d38a0f2dc,,false,"Hello, I have had numerous arguments with my father about the death rate and infection rate of covid-19 and how he undersells it. I try to always do my own research on topics via scientific journals and more middle ground media. While I in my head have my thoughts about what things are from what I picked up, I feel my father is just quoting things that lean towards what we feels is right/is true. Today he quoted the following three paragraphs from [this article](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4425/rr-31) which I don't really believe is wholly true and might be cherry picking; pushing the ""covid is just the flu"" narrative:

&gt;Suppression of science and lack of open debate has impinged enormously on three issues of fundamental significance. Firstly, public fear of Covid has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion to the actual danger. A recent peer-reviewed paper by one of the world’s most cited and respected scientist, Professor John Ioannidis of Stanford University, quotes an infection fatality rate (IFR) for Covid of 0.00-0.57% (0.05% for under 70s), far lower than originally feared and no different to severe flu [3]. This paper is published on WHO’s own Bulletin but ignored by UK mainstream media.

 

&gt;Secondly, although deaths are currently running at normal levels, fear is being driven by inflation of Covid “cases” caused by inappropriate use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test [4-7]. This test is hypersensitive and highly susceptible to contamination, particularly when not processed with utmost rigour by properly trained staff. Case inflation also occurs from use of excessive number of rounds of amplification cycles (termed CT) which amplifies non-infectious viral fragments and cross-reacting nucleotides from non-Covid coronaviruses/other respiratory viruses. These become mis-labelled as Covid. Even Dr Fauci confirms that a positive result using CT above 34 is invalid (Twitter thread, Jeff Nelson @vegsource 30 October 2020) but in the UK CTs may go up to 45, as confirmed by Professor Carl Heneghan of Oxford University’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine: (House of Commons Science &amp; Tech Committee, 17 Sep, 2020 YouTube.) An obvious improvement is to immediately halt any use of CTs above 34 and ensure that for CTs between 25 and 34, two consecutive positive results are required before confirming a case as Covid positive.

 

&gt;According to Professor Brookes, a Health Data Scientist from the University of Leicester, the UK’s official data shows no excess deaths due to respiratory infections this season (talkRadio, 'The number of people dying today is the same as it would be any other year', 17 November 2020 YouTube).

Whilst there is no question that the first wave of Covid, a then novel virus, was lethal to many, there is no sound evidence of any second wave.

 

&gt;The third and possibly the most consequential suppression of science relates to the narrative that people do not develop immunity following a Covid infection. We know that immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is very durable, persisting for at least 12-17 years [8-10]. Immunologists know that immunity to SARS-Cov-2 is no different.

  Now REWIND 24 HOURS, when i left for work that morning, there is a set of rail road tracks that run through our whole neighborhood. This train was sitting behind my house. FOR WEEKS!
    i had called multiple times to move this railcar. Its illegal to park where they did. They have an entire train yard 50 yards away. 

     So the day everything happened, they had finally moved this train, they blocked the neighboring street, tracks THEY NEVER USE! THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD. AFTER I GOT THE CALL ABOUT MY DAD I RUSH DOWN MY USUAL STREET AND ITS BLOCKED BY A TRAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 PLUS YEARS. 

     i go around. Im 2 minutes off. I run  up the stairs and unlock the doors. Ems never followed me in. I came back to the door and yelled WHT ARE YOU FUCKING WAITIN FOR!??! 
   I RUN UP THE STAIRS  looking at the blood from my father as i run to the second story, he had dragged himself back up the stairs.. 

    I see him, laying face down on his bed. He isnt moving. He isnt breathing. I shake him. I yell for him to wake up. DAD ! DAAAD! DAD WAKE UP! HE DOESNT MOVE. (I have medical experience) i notice he soiled himself, and then i knew. I was literally 2 minutes too late. 

Honestly TOLEDO ems. Y'ALL NEED SOME WORK! SO.
 My dad, hes gone. Then came his father. I moved from ohio to tn. Cared for my grandfather for a few months til he eventually succumbed to kidney failure without dialisys.

  It's messed up. I still havnt found a way to deal with my loss.

  I not only lost my father and grandfather before covid. I had to Deal with my loss in quarantine. But just before this, i lost both of my grandmothers, my closest uncle, my husbands father....
 and i just cant help but wonder. Was it covid before covid started??? 

  It was already here but we had no warnings. No one had traveled in my family. We lost 8 people im 3 months BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT DID ANYTHING!!! AM I WORNG???

Hello, Friends all Nation! I would like to concern you all regarding the devastating corona case in **INDIA**. Every day lakh’s of people are being affected by corona. Thousand’s of people are dying daily in every region of our country. Each day we break our record of patients and death tolls. Doctors, Politicians, the Army, industrialists, Entrepreneurs, Religious institutes, NGO’s and many sections of our societies are trying their best to help each other in these devastating conditions. Due to record cases, hospitals are treating patients in full capacity. Tones of oxygen are used daily for treatment in these hospitals. Lots of medicine are used for the treatment of patients daily. Due to this many of the regions in our country have an acute shortage of oxygen and essential medicine. Our Pharma Industries are trying their best by working at full capacity to deal with this shortage of medicine and oxygen. Some countries are already helping us by providing oxygen tanks, airlifting mobile oxygen plants, providing us doses of vaccines as much as they can. But after all these efforts are being made the conditions are getting worse day by day. People are traumatizing with fear! Families are losing their loved ones, Doctors are losing their will. Fear is arising among all of us. But all we have is hope!

I urge all the people who read this to please provide the people of India, **Hope!**

**Hope to live again, to be with our loved ones again, to be healthy again, to live with freedom again, and to be United AGAIN!**

Your one small wish to concern about this situation for us can ignite the ray of hope again among ourselves to overcome our fear now.

Thank’s for reading this Sir/Madam.",1619281213
6085a4c80dced36d38a0f2eb,,false,"Hello, I have had numerous arguments with my father about the death rate and infection rate of covid-19 and how he undersells it. I try to always do my own research on topics via scientific journals and more middle ground media. While I in my head have my thoughts about what things are from what I picked up, I feel my father is just quoting things that lean towards what we feels is right/is true. Today he quoted the following three paragraphs from [this article](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4425/rr-31) which I don't really believe is wholly true and might be cherry picking; pushing the ""covid is just the flu"" narrative:

&gt;Suppression of science and lack of open debate has impinged enormously on three issues of fundamental significance. Firstly, public fear of Covid has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion to the actual danger. A recent peer-reviewed paper by one of the world’s most cited and respected scientist, Professor John Ioannidis of Stanford University, quotes an infection fatality rate (IFR) for Covid of 0.00-0.57% (0.05% for under 70s), far lower than originally feared and no different to severe flu [3]. This paper is published on WHO’s own Bulletin but ignored by UK mainstream media.

 

&gt;Secondly, although deaths are currently running at normal levels, fear is being driven by inflation of Covid “cases” caused by inappropriate use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test [4-7]. This test is hypersensitive and highly susceptible to contamination, particularly when not processed with utmost rigour by properly trained staff. Case inflation also occurs from use of excessive number of rounds of amplification cycles (termed CT) which amplifies non-infectious viral fragments and cross-reacting nucleotides from non-Covid coronaviruses/other respiratory viruses. These become mis-labelled as Covid. Even Dr Fauci confirms that a positive result using CT above 34 is invalid (Twitter thread, Jeff Nelson @vegsource 30 October 2020) but in the UK CTs may go up to 45, as confirmed by Professor Carl Heneghan of Oxford University’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine: (House of Commons Science &amp; Tech Committee, 17 Sep, 2020 YouTube.) An obvious improvement is to immediately halt any use of CTs above 34 and ensure that for CTs between 25 and 34, two consecutive positive results are required before confirming a case as Covid positive.

 

&gt;According to Professor Brookes, a Health Data Scientist from the University of Leicester, the UK’s official data shows no excess deaths due to respiratory infections this season (talkRadio, 'The number of people dying today is the same as it would be any other year', 17 November 2020 YouTube). Instead, excess total deaths have been driven by lack of treatment due to hospital closure/lockdowns and have occurred mostly at home. Whilst there is no question that the first wave of Covid, a then novel virus, was lethal to many, there is no sound evidence of any second wave.

 

&gt;The third and possibly the most consequential suppression of science relates to the narrative that people do not develop immunity following a Covid infection. We know that immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is very durable, persisting for at least 12-17 years [8-10]. Immunologists know that immunity to SARS-Cov-2 is no different. This is confirmed by many eminent scientists including Beda M Stadler, the former Director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Bern and Professor Emeritus (Ivor Cummins, Ep91 Emeritus Professor of Immunology...Reveals Crucial Viral Immunity Reality, 28 July 2020, YouTube), and Sucharit Bhakdi, former Chair of Medical Microbiology at the University of Mainz [11]. The human population has encountered and co-existed with myriad coronaviruses throughout evolution. Most of us therefore have cross-reacting T-cells, B cells and antibodies derived from encounters with cold coronaviruses that can recognise SARS-CoV-2 [12-14], in the same way that people “immunised” with cowpox became less susceptible to serious illness from smallpox - as Edward Jenner discovered in 1796. This is why we do not generally die from cold coronaviruses and precisely why so many of us were not susceptible to falling severely ill from Covid earlier this year. Even the chance of passing Covid to your spouse at the height of the pandemic was as low as 17%! [15 ].

Is all or any of this publication accurate? If not, whats a good mix of sources that I can look into and let him know about? I want to be as clear on the topic as possible because I am aware of misinformation campaigns that are about right now. Thank for for at least reading through, and hopefully this can serve as a good reference for others in similar situations too!",1619315210
6085a4c80dced36d38a0f2ec,,false,Hey so I am 17 and I got the pfizer shot and I had a pretty bad reaction the night of just getting a fever and chills but then 2 days later I wake up and there’s a huge rash on my face !?!??? Did anything like this happen to someone,1619307264
6085a4c80dced36d38a0f2ed,,false,"So, I should preface by explaining that I have severe anxiety that manifests in multiple ways, including physical symptoms and really bad OCD. This was BEFORE covid. Now...it's impossible to describe. My own mind is my worst enemy, the anxiety never stops. Calling it 'coronaphobia' doesn't begin to cover my fear. For the first 3 months I wouldn't leave the INSIDE of my house. And I still won't go into the backyard without a mask.

So right now, I'm worried about starting to go out/be around people again with vaccines rolling out (I'm getting my second Pfizer Ednesday- and already paranoid about both having and not having side effects, but anyway). Like, what if vaccine passports aren't utilized? Will it just never be safe to go to indoor restaurants or movie theaters again? 

And even if they are, what about different vaccines? I know everything they say about how we can't KNOW the vaccines aren't equal, but enough new studies have been done to show the numbers are still pretty significantly different. And literally ALL the focus is on just any vaccine that prevents death. I get that that's the most important factor, I really do. But it seems like nobody even CARES about reducing the chance of actually getting infected anymore. And when even asymptomatic infections can lead to long term health problems, is it safe to be close with someone who got, say, Johnson and Johnson as opposed to Pfizer or Moderna? 

I know all the statistics, I know what the experts say. I know I'm protected to the extent my vaccine allows, but vaccines also rely on other people being vaccinated (and the extent to which they are) in order to provide minimal risk. Even with a vaccine, surveys show most people, like me, don't want to be in close contact with unvaccinated people. But what about vaccinated people with different efficacies, and therefore different chances of getting infected? For example, Johnson and Johnson leaves a significant chance for INFECTION open- is my Pfizer going to be as effective around people who got J and J as it is around people who got Moderna and Pfizer? Will we ever reach herd immunity (or even fully end the pandemic- not the virus, the actual pandemic) with a large part of the population only 66% vaccinated against actual infection (and I've read all the stuff about how you shouldn't compare the vaccines, they were tested at different times, blah blah blah- but Pfizer and Moderna have been tested since and still show stronger efficacy)? 

I already know what the experts say, but as I said before, I don't think the experts are considering all the risks- or, more likely, I think they're deliberately not ADDRESSING all the risks in a well-meaning but misguided attempt to get whatever vaccine in as many arms as soon as possible. 

I'm not even 30 yet, and my anxiety and depression and autism diagnosis mean I haven't even STARTED my life- will I have to live drowning in fear of covid for the rest of it?

(I'm really sorry for the length- I wanted to address everything and I have a tendency to be verbose while writing anyway &gt;.&lt; Also, please know that I don't mean to be rude or imply negative things about anyone based on their choice or availability, nor am I trying to create any kind of vaccine caste system. If anything came out poorly, I'm very sorry- like I said, I have aspergers and even though I try very hard, sometimes my words just come out badly. That's not what I intend at all- I'm just VERY anxious and afraid and wanted to be as honest/thorough as possible.)",1619305155
6085a4c80dced36d38a0f2ee,,false,"Hi all, 

I had the second dose of Pfizer yesterday and have been crippled in bed all day due in large part to a headache. I has covid in Dec and had a very strange headache then and again after my first dose. But the headache I have today is different and I wonder if it should be cause for concern. I have taken two ES Tylenol and slept, but the uncomfortable pain in my neck and a tension in my forehead persist. I have been tossing and turning for hours it is so uncomfortable.

Thoughts?",1619291635
6085a4c80dced36d38a0f2f0,,false,"The seriousness of this matter I'm experiencing with Covid-19 has caused me to create this account and hopefully connect with someone that can share their similar experience with me. 

I started showing Covid-19 symptoms (thought it was a sinus infection) for 4 days, then tested positive on day 5. My symptoms were mild for the most part, much like a mild raspatory infection. However, day 7-8 of showing symptoms I started having shortness of breath. This lasted for only 2-3 days and then started to get better. The issue arising is I'm currently on day 15, and day 12-15 I have been having continuous coming and going of AWFUL headaches. These headaches literally debilitate me to lying in bed until it eventually passes. I've gone to the doctor and my vitals are fine and they said there is nothing directly causing the headaches besides they believe lasting Covid-19 symptom. 

My question is if anyone else has had lingering headaches similar to the timeline of mine? If so, how long did this headaches last and did anything help? I'm hoping my 3rd week from testing positive will hopefully phase these headaches out.",1619286116
6085a4c80dced36d38a0f2ef,,false,"This is gonna be a long one so pls be patient.

So, I’ve been going to the doctor/ER pretty often lately for reasons unrelated to COVID. I had to sign a waiver that said they treat COVID   patients in that hospital and it’s a possibility that I might get it. I also removed my mask for one of the tests they were running and in the bathroom. Dumb on my part, I know.

I started having weird body/leg aches, a fever that only lasted for a day, congestion in my nose, and a migraine. This went away and stopped bothering me a couple days ago. 

Last night, I was trying to sleep when I got super nauseous and felt my fever come back. I was super tired so I just went to sleep. When I woke up, my face was SUPER FLUSHED and warm (I am usually very pale in my face), a pounding headache, body aches, fever, chills and overall malaise.

I got tested about an hour ago but I have to wait 3 days for my results. Am I gonna die? I’m really nervous. Any tips for my symptoms while I wait for my results?",1619303578

6085a4cb0dced36d38a0f2f5,,false,"It is a long story but i'll start where i can. (typing this out is going to be a bitch.) So the start of 2020. Obviously this was something everyone can relate to. March 3rd. This is before any covid news hit the u.s. I was at work when i got a call from my husband, my dad had fallen down the stairs of my childhood home.

 I knew something was wrong, my dad had never fallen out of nowhere before, he was only 56. I called my dad, and he sounded exhausted, so tired he could barely speak. Luckily, i only worked 3 minutes away EXACTLY..

 I asked him if he needed medical attention and he said he wasnt sure. I quickly hung up with my dad and darted to my truck across the parkinlot. As i am running, i CALL 911 AND tell them to meet me there.

  Now REWIND 24 HOURS, when i left for work that morning, there is a set of rail road tracks that run through our whole neighborhood. This train was sitting behind my house. FOR WEEKS!
    i had called multiple times to move this railcar. Its illegal to park where they did. They have an entire train yard 50 yards away. 

     So the day everything happened, they had finally moved this train, they blocked the neighboring street, tracks THEY NEVER USE! THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD. AFTER I GOT THE CALL ABOUT MY DAD I RUSH DOWN MY USUAL STREET AND ITS BLOCKED BY A TRAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 PLUS YEARS. 

     i go around. Im 2 minutes off. I run  up the stairs and unlock the doors. Ems never followed me in. I came back to the door and yelled WHT ARE YOU FUCKING WAITIN FOR!??! 
   I RUN UP THE STAIRS  looking at the blood from my father as i run to the second story, he had dragged himself back up the stairs.. 

    I see him, laying face down on his bed. He isnt moving. He isnt breathing. I shake him. I yell for him to wake up. DAD ! DAAAD! DAD WAKE UP! HE DOESNT MOVE. (I have medical experience) i notice he soiled himself, and then i knew. I was literally 2 minutes too late. 

Honestly TOLEDO ems. Y'ALL NEED SOME WORK! SO.

But what about vaccinated people with different efficacies, and therefore different chances of getting infected? For example, Johnson and Johnson leaves a significant chance for INFECTION open- is my Pfizer going to be as effective around people who got J and J as it is around people who got Moderna and Pfizer? Will we ever reach herd immunity (or even fully end the pandemic- not the virus, the actual pandemic) with a large part of the population only 66% vaccinated against actual infection (and I've read all the stuff about how you shouldn't compare the vaccines, they were tested at different times, blah blah blah- but Pfizer and Moderna have been tested since and still show stronger efficacy)? 

I already know what the experts say, but as I said before, I don't think the experts are considering all the risks- or, more likely, I think they're deliberately not ADDRESSING all the risks in a well-meaning but misguided attempt to get whatever vaccine in as many arms as soon as possible. 

I'm not even 30 yet, and my anxiety and depression and autism diagnosis mean I haven't even STARTED my life- will I have to live drowning in fear of covid for the rest of it?

(I'm really sorry for the length- I wanted to address everything and I have a tendency to be verbose while writing anyway &gt;.&lt; Also, please know that I don't mean to be rude or imply negative things about anyone based on their choice or availability, nor am I trying to create any kind of vaccine caste system. If anything came out poorly, I'm very sorry- like I said, I have aspergers and even though I try very hard, sometimes my words just come out badly. That's not what I intend at all- I'm just VERY anxious and afraid and wanted to be as honest/thorough as possible.)",1619305155

I had the second dose of Pfizer yesterday and have been crippled in bed all day due in large part to a headache. I has covid in Dec and had a very strange headache then and again after my first dose. But the headache I have today is different and I wonder if it should be cause for concern. I have taken two ES Tylenol and slept, but the uncomfortable pain in my neck and a tension in my forehead persist. I have been tossing and turning for hours it is so uncomfortable.

Thoughts?",1619291635

I started showing Covid-19 symptoms (thought it was a sinus infection) for 4 days, then tested positive on day 5. My symptoms were mild for the most part, much like a mild raspatory infection. However, day 7-8 of showing symptoms I started having shortness of breath. This lasted for only 2-3 days and then started to get better. The issue arising is I'm currently on day 15, and day 12-15 I have been having continuous coming and going of AWFUL headaches. These headaches literally debilitate me to lying in bed until it eventually passes. I've gone to the doctor and my vitals are fine and they said there is nothing directly causing the headaches besides they believe lasting Covid-19 symptom. 

My question is if anyone else has had lingering headaches similar to the timeline of mine? If so, how long did this headaches last and did anything help? I'm hoping my 3rd week from testing positive will hopefully phase these headaches out.",1619286116

So, I’ve been going to the doctor/ER pretty often lately for reasons unrelated to COVID. I had to sign a waiver that said they treat COVID   patients in that hospital and it’s a possibility that I might get it. I also removed my mask for one of the tests they were running and in the bathroom. Dumb on my part, I know.

I started having weird body/leg aches, a fever that only lasted for a day, congestion in my nose, and a migraine. This went away and stopped bothering me a couple days ago. 

Last night, I was trying to sleep when I got super nauseous and felt my fever come back. I was super tired so I just went to sleep. When I woke up, my face was SUPER FLUSHED and warm (I am usually very pale in my face), a pounding headache, body aches, fever, chills and overall malaise.

I got tested about an hour ago but I have to wait 3 days for my results. Am I gonna die? I’m really nervous. Any tips for my symptoms while I wait for my results?",1619303578
